Our next event will be announced soon. In the meantime check out the [New York R Conference](https://www.rstats.nyc).

<!--
From time to time we put on events beyond the regular meetup programming such as the [New York R Conference](www.rstats.nyc) and master classes in topics such as Rcpp, Stan, data.table and other advanced topics.

Our next event is a __three-day__ [Stan class](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learn-bayes-mcmc-and-stan-2017-with-andrew-gelman-jonah-gabry-michael-betancourt-tickets-36284546054) taught by [__Andrew Gelman__](http://andrewgelman.com/), [__Jonah Gabry__](http://jgabry.github.io/about/) and [__Michael Betancourt__](https://betanalpha.github.io/).

This __three-day__ course consists of three main themes: Bayesian inference and computation; the Stan programming language; applied statistics.
Participants will receive a copy of Andrew Gelman's landmark book [__Bayesian Data Analysis__](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). Proceeds from the class support __further development__ of Stan and this meetup.

Before class everyone __should install__ [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and [RStan](http://mc-stan.org/rstan.html) on their computers. If problems occur please join the [stan-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stan-users) group and post any questions. It is __important__ that all participants get Stan running and bring their laptops to the course.

Class structure and example topics for the three days:

## Day 1: Foundations

- Foundations of Bayesian inference 
- Foundations of Bayesian computation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- Intro to Stan with hands-on exercises 
- Real-life Stan
- Bayesian Workflow

## Day 2: Linear and Generalized Linear Models

- Foundations of Bayesian regression
- Fitting GLMs in Stan (e.g., logistic regression, Poisson regression)
- Diagnosing model misfit using graphical posterior predictive checks
- Little data: How traditional statistical ideas remain relevant in a big data world
- Generalizing from sample to population (surveys, xbox example, etc)

## Day 3: Hierarchical Models

- Foundations of Bayesian hierarchical/multilevel models
- Accurately fitting hierarchical models in Stan
- Why we donâ€™t (usually) have to worry about multiple comparisons
- Hierarchical modeling and prior information
- Topics

Specific topics on Bayesian inference and computation include, but are not limited to:

- Bayesian inference and prediction
- Naive Bayes, supervised, and unsupervised classification
- Overview of Monte Carlo methods
- Convergence and effective sample size
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the no-U-turn sampler
- Continuous and discrete-data regression models
- Mixture models
- Measurement-error and item-response models
- Specific topics on Stan include, but are not limited to:
- Reproducible research
- Probabilistic programming
- Stan syntax and programming
- Optimization
- Warmup, adaptation, and convergence
- Identifiability and problematic posteriors
- Handling missing data
- Ragged and sparse data structures
