            "<p>This first meeting will be your opportunity to help shape the direction for this group.<\/p> <p>With recent exposure in the NY Times, R is become less of an obscure tool confined to academia. The R-SIG-Finance list is full of New Yorkers who apply R in financial settings. Inside Google, Facebook and other data intensive companies, R plays an important role in helping analysts understand ecosystems.<\/p> <p>And R can be a lot of fun to use too. A powerful, and sometimes painful, mix of functional, imperative and object-oriented programming - the learning curve is steep and many things don't work as one would expect. Given this, I find it terribly useful to keep in touch with other R programmers as I'm always learning new tricks and improving my skills.<\/p> <p>Meeting Agenda:<\/p> <p>1. Introduction to R<br/>2. Machine Learning in R<br/>3. Whit Armstrong will talk about his Financial Time Series package<br/>4. Suggestions for future meetings discussion<br/>5. General R Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>I hope to see you there.<\/p> "

            "<p>This month's meetup will focus on the applications of R to academic research. Econometrics and social network analysis have formed the methodological foundation for most contemporary empirical social science research. As such, there are several R packages for performing this type of analysis. Andrew Little and Drew Conway of the Department of Politics at NYU will present a brief overview of a few of the most useful packages in this space.<\/p> <p><b>Econometrics<\/b><br/>Andrew will discuss two econometric packages developed by Gary King of Harvard, and how he has used them in his research.<\/p> <p><a href='http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/'>Zelig<\/a> - a single, easy-to-use package that can estimate, help interpret, and present the results of a large range of statistical methods.<br/><a href='http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit/'>MatchIt<\/a> - implements a wide range of sophisticated matching methods, making it possible to greatly reduce the dependence of causal inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, statistical modeling assumptions.<\/p> <p><br/><b>Social Network Analysis<\/b><br/>Drew will discuss network analysis in R and provide a an overview of how to perform it through example.

As time permits, the presenters may introduce a range of additional topics, such as (a) the difference between .C() and .Call(), (b) our approach to handling massive matrices (potentially exceeding available RAM, and potentially shared across R processes), or (c) very elegant tools for parallel computing (package \"foreach\" by Steve Weston). Each of these latter topics relate to package design in interesting ways.<\/p> <p><b>Note<\/b>: given the success of the pre-meetup networking at the February meetup, we will again have some coffee and snacks starting at 6:15pm, and the talks will begin promptly at 7pm. As before, we are asking for a donation of $5.00 from each member to cover the cost of catering. You may make your donation now using PayPal, or in cash at the meetup.<\/p> "

Each presenter will discuss their topic for 10-15 minutes, and then the audience will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback.<\/p> <p><br/>Pankaj Chopra - using R and Bioconductor (<a href='http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install/'><a href='http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install/\" class=\"linkified'>http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install/<\/a><\/a>) for biomarker detection in cancer<br/>Andrew Ilardi - an R project that analyzes a list of stocks while reaching out to the web to pull their historical prices, then plots Quarter over Quarter correlations and a year over year scatter plot.<br/>Jared Lander - analyzing data from 30 countries in the World Health Survey that were the result of a comprehensive look at the lives of thousands of people in each country, we fit multilevel models using lmer() to model and display the differing affect wealth has on the probability of contracting Noncommunicable Diseases at differing levels of development. Jared will also be sharing his research on <a href='http://www.jaredlander.com/wordpress/wordpress-2.9.2/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Pizza-Thesis.pdf'>finding the best pizza in NYC<\/a>, and how he used R in this research.<br/>Andrew Little - often in game theory (and presumably other applied math settings) we are interested in the behavior of equations with no explicit solution. I will demonstrate how I use the optim() and other functions in R for such situations in my research<br/>John Myles White - use of R for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain, and review the basic ideas behind fMRI analysis and show how it can be easily implemented in R using only default functions.<\/p> <p><br/>As you can see, quite an eclectic assortment of topics that I am sure everyone will find interesting. Thanks to all of the speakers for volunteering. We will have the usual networking time starting at 6:15pm and speakers will begin promptly at 7:00pm.<\/p> <p>See you in April!<\/p> "

            "<p><a href='http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/'>Mark Hansen<\/a> -- on sabbatical at the New York Times R&amp;D Group from the Department of Statistics, UCLA -- will talk about the use of R for teaching data analysis at both the undergraduate and high school levels. The talk will draw on recent experiences with the Los Angeles Unified School District and the design of a six-week data analysis unit within a year-long computer science curriculum. While the talk is framed around problems related to teaching, it involves themes and data types that are not typically discussed in an introductory statistics class.<\/p> <p>Broadly, the unit is designed as a kind of \"participatory sensing\" exercise. Participatory sensing is a variation on traditional embedded sensing that enlists the efforts of the general public to collect and analyze data. In our case, Google has generously donated a number of G2 phones that students use to capture geo-tagged and timestamped observations. From a practical perspective, the talk surveys R packages for representing, visualizing and modeling data on time and location, as well as images and text. Students in the unit learn a kind of story telling with fairly complex data -- An activity that is not entirely distinct from traditional statistics, but, given the unit's position within a computer science course, emphasizes computation over mathematics, information technology and the \"mechanics of data\" over probability and analytical approximations.<\/p> <p>Finally, Mark will discuss how this work has been extended to other outlets for this kind of story telling, and include a presentation of a number of public art works that draw on data feeds. These include Moveable Type, a permanent artwork in the lobby of the New York Times Building; and <a href='http://stewdio.org/work/terrenatale/'>Terre Natale<\/a>, and a recent commission by the Cartier Foundation on the theme of global migration.<\/p> "

            "<p>Thanks to Peter Flom for suggesting this meetup idea! The June meetup will focus on how to overcome programming errors and bugs when coding in R. While originally I intended this meetup to also address data types and vectorizied operation, upon the sage advise of fellow members I have decided to table those topics for a future meetup.<\/p> <p>As such, the scheduled topics and speakers for June are:<\/p> <p><br/>Debugging basics - Jay Emerson will review basic core functions for simple debugging, including print(), cat() and browser()<br/>Advanced debugging - Harlan Harris will build on Jay's introduction and provide an interactive introduction to more advanced debugging techniques using traceback(), trace() and debug()<br/>Using the REvo IDE for debugging - Joseph Rickerts of <a href='http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/'>REvolution Analytics<\/a> will provide a brief tutorial on using their IDE for debugging<br/>Demystifying error messages - Finally, Peter Flom will discuss several error messages he has run into while learning R, provide some replication code, and go over where they come from and how to avoid them.<\/p> <p><br/>As is tradition, we will provide some light catering starting at 6:15pm, and invite everyone to arrive early to have a snack and do some networking with your fellow data nerds before the taks. Speakers will begin promptly at 7pm, which will be followed by informal beeR gathering at a local watering hole for those that can stay.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have our speakers! Thank you to everyone who has volunteered to talk about using R to explore open data. You will find the schedule below, but I would like to highlight two changes to our normal operating procedures for this month.<\/p> <p>First, as with previous meetups with multiple speakers, each speaker will have fifteen minutes to present. In an effort to maintain a tighter schedule, however, this month we will be <b>keeping talks to exactly 15 minutes<\/b>. Speakers will be given 5 and 1 minute warnings---just like a conference! Second, because fifteen minutes is not a lot of time to discuss the technical aspects of the analysis, we will be experimenting with a \"<i>How'd They Do That<\/i>\" portion of the meetup. After the talks, presenters will break off into smaller groups and have a chance to discuss the actual R code used to produce their analysis; take questions, and provide further examples. My hope is that this will give people a chance to ask more specific questions and interact with presenters.<\/p> <p>Schedule:<\/p> <p><br/>6:15pm-7pm: NetwoRking (with refreshments)<br/>7pm-8pm: Presentations<\/p> <p><br/>Sean Goggins: Evolution of discourse centered networks in MyLyn Eclipse Plugin<br/>Ronald Calitri: Population nutrition in Iraq districts modeled from international data<br/>WikiLeaks Team - Multiple analyses of WikiLeaks Afghan War Diaries data by Mike Dewar, Harlan Harris, John Myles White and Drew Conway<\/p> <p>8pm-the bar: How'd they do that?<\/p> <p>There is room for one more presenter, so if you would like to give a short talk on something you are working on in R with open data please let me know. Thank you again to Shane for <a href='http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/ideas/283019/'>this great idea<\/a>. I am very much looking forward to seeing everyone in September!<\/p> "

            "<p>This month we are very lucky to have Prof. Andrew Gelman, Statistics, Columbia University, presenting some of his most recent research. Below is a brief description of Prof. Gelman's talk:<\/p> <p><i>A challenge in statistics is to construct models that are structured enough to be able to learn from data but not be so strong as to overwhelm the data. We introduce the concept of  œweakly informative priors   which contain important information but less than may be available for the given problem at hand. We also discuss some related problems in developing general models for interactions. We consider how these ideas apply to problems in social science and public health. All the work for these projects was done in R.<\/i><\/p> <p>The schedule for this meetup will follow our usual format: networking with refreshments starting at 6:15pm, then Prof. Gelman will begin at 7pm.<\/p> "

Chris has been kind enough to offer to present his work on Bayesian estimation using MCMC, despite the fact that he will no doubt be exhausted from having run a marathon the day before.<\/p> <p>Chris is one of the co-creators of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/pymc/'>PyMC<\/a>, the premier package for MCMC estimation in Python. From PyMC's website:<\/p> <p><i>Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However, few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are non-trivial to code by hand. PyMC is a python module that implements the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.<\/i><\/p> <p>You'll note that this presentation <b>does not directly involve R<\/b>, and there are a couple of reasons for this:<\/p> <p><br/>Chris has greatly contributed to the statistical computing community, and we are lucky to have him<br/>Given the <a href='http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2010/09/ross_ihaka_to_r.html'>recent consternation within the R community<\/a> about the language, it is valuable to understand how other languages approach statistical computing<br/>We always say the R meetup is the satellite Python meetup, and now we can make that official. I have also invited the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/nycpython/'>Python users group<\/a> to this meetup, and I hope it will be an opportunity for these communities to mingle.<\/p> <p><br/>Chris is going to send me a brief description of his talk in the coming days, and I will update this announcement when I receive it.<\/p> <p>Finally, depending on time and interest level, I may also present a brief follow-up to Chris's talk on integrating R with PyMC using some of the various tools that exist to bridge R to Python.<\/p> <p>Please let me know if you have any questions.<\/p> "

            "<p>For our final meetup of 2010 we are very lucky to be hosting a group of current and former Google engineers. Ni Wang and Max Lin (currently at Google), and Mark Ko (former intern) will discuss their work at Google, and how they use R to analyze data. Below is a description of their talk:<\/p> <p><i>Data plays a central role at Google. R is one of the important tools used by analysts and engineers at Google for analyzing data. In the talk, we will first show a few examples on how R is currently used at Google to solve some analytical problems. We then discuss how R has gained its popularity in both analysts and engineering communities. In the second half of the talk, we discuss our plans to make R more integrated with internal machine learning algorithms and infrastructure. We will introduce an R client library for the Google Prediction API, which is a machine learning web service running on the cloud.<\/i><\/p> <p>Please note that we are <b>switching locations again<\/b>, and will be meeting at AOL headquarters downtown.<\/p> <p>Finally, I have listed the time as 7pm, which is when the talk will begin. As usual, however, I will have pizzas delivered about 6:15pm and everyone is welcome to join for some netwoRking.<\/p> <p>Hope to see you in December!<\/p> "

This will include many wonderful things:<\/p> <p>Shwag-tastic Revolution Analytics give-aways: stickers, t-shirts, and teddy bears--oh my!

This month, Wes will be speaking specifically about two packages he has created related to data manipulation in Python and analysis.<\/p> <p>pandas is a Python library providing powerful and flexible data structures (similar to R's data.frame) and accompanying tools for data wrangling, time series, input / output, and visualization. statsmodels is a related Python project providing standard statistical and econometric models.<\/p> <p><a href='http://pandas.sourceforge.net/'><a href='http://pandas.sourceforge.net\" class=\"linkified'>http://pandas.sourceforge.net<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><a href='http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/'><a href='http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net\" class=\"linkified'>http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p>In this talk Wes will demo the features of both libraries, particularly as they relate to similar tools in R, as well as speak about planned work to create an better integrated statistical computing environment in Python.

            "<p>This month we are incredibly excited to host <a href='http://had.co.nz/'>Hadley Wickham<\/a>, Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University, and creator of many of the most popular R packages in CRAN.<\/p> <p>It's often said that 80% of the effort of analysis is spent just getting the data ready to analyse, the process of data cleaning. Data cleaning is not only a vital first step, but it is oftenrepeated multiple times over the course of an analysis as new problems come to light. Despite the amount of time it takes up, there has been little research on how to do clean data well. Part of the challenge is the breadth of activities that cleaning encompasses, from outlier checking to date parsing to missing value imputation. To get a handle on the problem, this talk focusses on a small, but important, subset of data cleaning that I call data \"tidying'\": getting the data in a format that is easy to manipulate, model, and visualise.  <\/p> <p>In this talk you'll see some of the crazy data sets that I've struggled with over the years, and learn the basic tools for making messy data tidy. I'll also discuss tidy tools, tools that take tidy data as input and return tidy data as output. The idea of a tidy tool is useful for critiquing existing R functions, and will help to explain why some tasks that seem like they should be easy are in fact quite hard. This work ties together <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html'>reshape2<\/a>, <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/'>plyr<\/a> and <a href='http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/'>ggplot2<\/a> with a consistent philosophy of data. Once you master this data format, you'll find it much easier to manipulate, model and visualise your data.<\/p> <p>This meetup will follow our usual schedule, with <b>pizza and networking starting at 6:15PM, Prof. Wickham at 7PM, and a post-meetup reception at a nearby bar<\/b>.<\/p> "

            "<p>This month we are pleased to welcome Nicholas Petraco to discuss the application of statistical computing to crime scene forensics.  Yeah, that's right, <b>we're getting all CSI in February!<\/b><\/p> <p>The practice of qualitative physical evidence comparison in forensic science has come under great scrutiny since the 2009 publication of the NAS report on  œStrengthening Forensic Science in the United States  . From a computational point of view,  œevidence   from a crime is simply data. Modern machine learning techniques can make associations between data samples from a suspect, and evidence from a crime scene quantitative and objective. Specifically, given multivariate data constituting evidence in a crime, how likely is it that a conclusion of association with a suspect is erroneous?<\/p> <p>This presentation will discuss how our group of forensic researchers and practitioners are using R to be able to answer this question. Projects discussed will be on the use of principal component analysis (PCA), canonical variate analysis (CVA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM), resampling, conformal prediction theory (CPT) and empirical Bayes methods to establish identification systems and estimated error rates on firearms and tool mark evidence, dust discrimination, fire debris evidence, footwear associations and questioned photocopier analysis.<\/p> <p><br/><i>Speaker Bio<\/i>: Nicholas D. K. Petraco earned a bachelors degree in Chemistry from Colgate University in 1998 and a doctorate in Quantum Chemistry at University of Georgia, Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry in 2002. He was a postdoctoral fellow in Applied Mathematics at the University of Waterloo from 2002-2004 where after he was appointed to an Assistant Professorship at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and The Graduate Center, City University of New York. Currently Nick is an Associate Professor at CUNY and belongs to the American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), the North Eastern Association of Forensic Scientists (NEAFS), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). His research interests are in the application of computing and advanced statistical pattern recognition methods to physical evidence.<\/p> <p><b>Schedule will proceed as usual<\/b>: food and networking starting at 6:15pm, Nicholas will begin promptly at 7pm, and we will migrate to a local watering hole afterwards.<\/p> "

            "<p>After a brief hiatus, we are very excited to announce our May meetup will feature one of the hottest new languages in statistical computing: <a href='http://julialang.org/'>Julia<\/a>.  We are delighted to welcome <a href='http://karpinski.org/'>Stefan Karpinski<\/a>, one of the creators of Julia, to give an introduction to the language and his perspective on statistical computing.<\/p> <p>Julia is a general-purpose, high-level, dynamic language in the tradition of Lisp, Perl, Python and Ruby. It is designed to take advantage of modern techniques for executing dynamic languages with statically-compiled performance. As part of this design, the language has an expressive type system, which programmers may leverage for dispatch and error checking    incidentally providing the compiler with useful type information. Using types is entirely optional, however: \"typeless Julia\" is a valid and useful subset of the language, similar to traditional dynamic languages, which nevertheless runs at statically compiled speeds.\\<\/p> <p>Julia is especially good at running Matlab and R-style programs. Given its level of performance, we envision a new era of technical computing where libraries can be developed in a high-level language instead of C or Fortran. We have also experimented with cloud API integration, and begun to develop a web-based interactive computing environment. The ultimate goal is to make cloud-based supercomputing as easy and accessible as Google Docs.<\/p> <p>We will also hear from a mix of people who have already started developing in Julia and see some examples of what they have developed.<\/p> <p>The meetup will follow our typical schedule: pizza will begin at 6:15pm, Stefan will begin promptly at 7pm, and we will head to The Central Bar around 8:30pm.<\/p> "

            "<p>Please join us as we welcome Carlos Scheidegger from AT&amp;T Labs as he presents his joint work with Simon Urbanek, also from AT&amp;T Labs.<\/p> <p>This talk will present ongoing work on an R-based EDA environment on a modern web browser. As organizations and businesses become more data-driven, EDA becomes increasingly important. In large organizations, sharing derived data, experiments, graphics and visualizations is still a hard problem, and is addressed mainly by stand-alone version-control systems. In contrast, we envision a system where users collaborate with each other fluidly, moving from a full-fledged R command prompt to integrated code search among all users to a simplified \"pick your analysis, visualization and data\" view. In this environment, sharing a new dataset, analysis or visualization should be as easy as creating it. We will show the current state of the tool via live demos.<\/p> <p>As always there will be pizza starting at 6:15pm, though this time we will be trying something a little different.  Most people in this group know my affinity for pizza.  So for each meetup we are going to order from a different place and we ask that you answer a quick poll (probably through the Meetup iOS/Android app) on how you like the pizza.  After the talk, around 8:30pm, we'll head to the bar, most likely Central Bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>What's the future of analytics in sports broadcasting?  Bloomberg Sports Head of Broadcast Rob Shaw looks to tackle that question.  Once limited to a niche of quant-minded sports enthusiasts, sabermetrics is now a bustling industry brought to the mainstream after the publishing of Moneyball by Michael Lewis in 2003.  Shaw will explain the challenges of bringing in-depth analytics to the mainstream audience in sports and how the second-screens such as iPads and smart phones will likely figure into its future.<\/p> <p>Shaw's background is in sports broadcasting and after earning his MBA at NYU Stern, he transitioned to business development at Bloomberg Sports.<\/p> <p>Please note the new location for this meetup.  We will be a the offices of Knewton, located at 100 5th Avenue on the 8th floor.<\/p> <p>As usual we will start off with pizza, this time from a place in Flatiron.<\/p> <p>Since the Giants are playing that night, following the talk we will go to a bar showing the game where Rob will hopefully give us a play-by-play of how the announcers get their crazy stats.<\/p> "

Thankfully Facebook gave us a huge hand and is hosting our meetup in their new offices on Madison Avenue.<\/p> <p>Our speaker this month is Ben Lerner, founder of <a href='https://datanitro.com/'>DataNitro<\/a> and recent MIT grad.<\/p> <p>DataNitro is a Y-Combinator backed tool that integrates Python into Excel as a replacement for VBA.  It provides access to all of Python's libraries, including SciPy, Pandas and QuantLib.  And yes, Ben has promised me he will soon build R integration as well.<\/p> <p>Ben will discuss how and why he built DataNitro and show what can be done with it.<\/p> <p>As usual, we will get pizza from a local place (for you to rate) starting at 6:15 and Ben will begin around 7.  After the talk we'll head to a nearby bar.<\/p> <p>Given the short notice and new space please RSVP quickly.  Please remember to show up at Facebook (335 Madison Ave (Bank of America Building), 17th floor) this month.<\/p> "

            "<p>For our last meetup of the year we will have John Myles White talking about JAGS:<\/p> <p>I'll present a brief introduction to probabilistic programming, a catch-all term for a new generation of programming languages that allow non-experts to fit arbitrary Bayesian models to small data sets. We'll cover the basic syntax of JAGS, a particularly accessible implementation of the BUGS language, and we'll then use the BUGS language to implement several basic Bayesian models, including linear regression, logistic regression, hierarchical regression and basic mixture models. Because of time considerations, I won't be presenting the basics of Bayesian inference, but will describe at a rough level how MCMC techniques are used to provide a backend for probabilistic programming languages.<\/p> <p>John Myles White is a Ph.D. student in the Princeton Psychology Department, where he studies behavioral decision theory. Along with Drew Conway, he is the author of the book  œMachine Learning for Hackers   as well as an upcoming book entitled \"Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization\". John has also worked on several popular R packages, including ProjectTemplate and log4r. He is currently working on building statistical packages for the new programming language Julia.<\/p> <p>We will have pizza from another new place, enjoy the talk, then hit the bar.<\/p> <p>Remember, this month will be at Pivotal Labs near Union Square who are very generously providing us with space.<\/p> "

            "<p>Happy new year and welcome back to NYOSP meetups.  To begin the year we have Sean Taylor (author of the much talked about blog post on the <a href='http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal'>Statistics Software Signal<\/a>) discussing ranking algorithms.<\/p> <p>About his talk:<\/p> <p>Ranking elements from a set of objects is a common statistical problem with applications ranging from web search and recommendation systems to modeling individual preferences or social hierarchies.  We all know--and probably use--approaches such as PageRank or logistic regression to create orderings of objects.  In this talk, I will describe the formal learning problem involved in inferring rankings which minimize different loss functions.  We'll then take a helicopter tour through a few common ranking techniques and apply them to example ranking problems from sports, social networks, and information retrieval.  I will also spend some time discussing regularization and active learning in these contexts, as well as when ranking models provide a bad approximation of reality.<\/p> <p>About Sean:<\/p> <p>Sean J. Taylor is a 5th year PhD candidate at NYU's Stern School of Business.  His work combines randomized experiments and Bayesian statistics to learn about social influence processes in the online world.  In addition to his work at NYU, he has conducted research at The Wharton School, the US Federal Reserve Board, and most recently with Facebook's Data Science team.  In his spare time, he analyzes NFL data to win his fantasy football league and find reasons to be optimistic about the Eagles.<\/p> <p>Even though he is an Eagles fan we'll still allow him to have pizza (starting at 6:15) and join us at the bar after the talk which will start around 7.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have a short turnaround time this month as we welcome Bryan Lewis to discuss SciDB.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>SciDB is an open-source database that organizes data in n-dimensional arrays.<\/p> <p>Interesting SciDB features include parallel processing, distributed storage, ACID transactions, efficient sparse array storage, and native linear algebra operations.<\/p> <p>The 'scidb' package for R provides two general ways to interact with SciDB from R:<br/>1. By running database queries from R transferring data using data.frame iterators.<br/>2. Through a sparse n-dimensional array object class for R inspired by the bigmemory package. The arrays mimic standard R arrays, but operations on them are performed by the SciDB engine.  Data are materialized to R only when requested.<\/p> <p>We illustrate using SciDB and R with a few examples including computing a truncated singular value decomposition of a large matrix, and bi-clustering of large arrays using the biclust package.<\/p> <p>About Bryan:<\/p> <p>Bryan Lewis has worked with R for a number of years and is the author of a number of R packages including irlba, rredis, doRedis, websockets, and bigalgebra, and others. He is the chief data scientist at Paradigm4 in Waltham, MA and has a Ph.D. in applied mathematics.<\/p> <p>Pizza starts at 6:15, Bryan will go on at 7 then we'll head to the bar.<\/p>"

            "<p>We have a busy month this April (more details on that later) and first up will be Thomas Levine and Brian Abelson discussing data audiozation (not sure if that's a real word but it works).  A brief abstract is below.<\/p> <p>Data visualization is an important part of traditional data analysis processes.

Before that he was a data scientist at the Harmony Institute, a non profit dedicated to measuring the influence of socially-driven media. He recently graduated with a MA in Applied Statistics from Columbia University where he focused on quantitative and computational approaches to social science. On the side, he edited a book for a prominent political scientist, participated in hackathons, and worked on investigative news stories. Brian is also the co-founder of csv soundsystem (<a href='http://csvsoundsystem.com/'>csvsoundsystem.com<\/a>), a hacker collective and datathon dream-team based in New York.<\/p> <p>## Thomas (<a href='http://thomaslevine.com/'>thomaslevine.com<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Thomas has been studying statistics and ergonomics since he was young, and computers since he was younger. This combination apparently makes him a data scientist. These days, he helps small organizations collect, manage and use data more effectively. He previously did data science/engineering at Scraperwiki, a website on which people write scripts to retrieve, clean, and analyze data sets. Last year, Thomas was named a \"data hero\" by DataKind for his superpowers. When he finds the time, Thomas studies how people use toilets, prints pretty things on letterpress, analyzes data about his hometown and runs various social experiments on his friends. His favorite color is pink.<\/p> <p>Pizza begins at 6:15, Thom and Brian go on at 7 followed by a trip to the bar.<\/p> <p>Silas Merez from Random House will be sponsoring this meetup as a thank you for the employees he found through the group.<\/p> "

            "<p>For our second meetup this month we are very excited to have Hadley Wickham presenting his new bigviz initiative.<\/p> <p>About his talk:<\/p> <p>R has a notorious reputation for not being able to deal with \"big\" data (and ggplot2 is a frequent culprit). Fortunately, this isn't an underlying problem with R, and it's something that we can fix with good programming practices and intelligent use of compiled code. In<br/>this talk, I'll introduce a new package, bigvis, that aims to make it easier (and faster) to work with very large datasets.<\/p> <p>Bigvis makes it possible to visualise 10-100 million observations in just a few seconds. It is built around a pipeline of bin, summarise, smooth and visualise, and makes minimal sacrifices of flexibility to achieve fast performance. As well as discussing the visualisation<br/>challenges when you have 10s of millions of observations, I'll also discuss the performance challenges, and how C++ and Rcpp make it pleasurable to integrate compiled code into R.<\/p> <p>For those of you who don't know about Hadley:<\/p> <p>Hadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio and an adjunct Assistant Professor at Rice University. He's interested in building tools (both computational and cognitive) that make data preparation, visualization and analysis easier. His contributions to R include over 30 R<br/>packages, for data analysis (ggplot2, plyr, reshape), making frustrating parts of R easier to use (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs), and for streamlining the R package development process (roxygen2, testthat, devtools, profr,<br/>staticdocs).<\/p> <p>Pizza starts at 6:15, Hadley will begin at 7 and we will head to the bar after.<\/p> <p>Thank you again to Knewton for hosting.<\/p> "

You will learn how to create interactive presentations, visualizations, web pages, blogs, applications and dashboards, straight from R.<\/p> <p>The advent of R Markdown and knitr have made it easy to create dynamic documents in different formats, including HTML. However, most content is still static and does not take full advantage of the web as an interactive medium. As a part of this talk, I will present a modular approach to inject interactivity into an R Markdown document using Slidify, rCharts and Shiny.<\/p> <p>PS. Please note that this talk will NOT discuss any statistical ideas.<\/p> <p>About Ramnath:<\/p> <p>Ramnath Vaidyanathan is an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at McGill University. His research focuses on the application of empirical methodologies to aid operational decisions in various settings including assortment planning, pricing and revenue management. He holds a PhD in Operations Management from the Wharton School, and has worked at McKinsey and Company.<\/p> <p>He is addicted to R and has developed two R packages, Slidify and rCharts, both aimed at simplifying the creation and sharing of interactive web-based content with R.<\/p> <p>Pizza starts at 6:15, the talk at 7, then we'll go to the bar after.<\/p> "

Pharmacoepidemiologic studies in particular routinely estimate temporal associations between medical product exposure and subsequent health outcomes of interest, and such studies influence prescribing patterns and healthcare policy more generally.  Some authors have questioned the reliability and accuracy of such studies, but few previous efforts have attempted to measure their performance.<\/p> <p>The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP, <a href='http://omop.org/'><a href='http://omop.org\" class=\"linkified'>http://omop.org<\/a><\/a>) has conducted a series of experiments to empirically measure the performance of various observational study designs with regard to predictive accuracy for discriminating between true drug effects and negative controls. In this talk, I describe the past work of the Partnership, explore opportunities to expand the use of observational data to further our understanding of medical products, and highlight areas for future research and development.<\/p> <p>Pizza starts at 6:15, Dr. Gelman Madigan begins at 7 and the bar will follow.  Right before the talk we will do giveaways including books and a free pass to Strata.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP early to help with seating arrangements.<\/p> <p>A big thanks to Dr. Madigan for filling in on such short notice.<\/p> "

From this talk you will know how to create, change, visualize, and statistically compare two trees of heirarchical clusterings (with some sprinkles of Rcpp).<\/p> <p><br/>The \"bonus talk\" in this meetup will be the 5-minutes lightining talk Tal gave in the recent useR!2013 conference about how to quickly update R on windows/mac, using the 'installr' package.<\/p> <p><br/>Then we have John:<\/p> <p>Streaming Data Analysis and Online Learning<\/p> <p><br/>John Myles White is one of the primary developers of Julia, a new language for technical computing. John is currently developing the statistical and machine learning infrastructure for Julia.  In addition, he is one of the residents at Hacker School's Summer 2013 program. John recently finished his Ph.D. at Princeton, where he developed models of human decision-making. During grad school, John co-wrote Machine Learning for Hackers and Bandit Algorithms for Website. Starting in the fall, John will be a research scientist at Facebook.<\/p> <p>Traditional statistical software suites are specialized for analyzing data sets that can fit in RAM. But many modern applications require that we analyze much larger data sets. In this talk, I'll survey some of the basic methods for analyzing data in a streaming manner. I'll focus on using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to fit models to data sets that arrive in small chunks. I'll discus some basic implementation issues and demonstrate the effectiveness of SGD for problems like linear and logistic regression as well as matrix factorization. I'll also describe how these methods allow ML systems to adapt to user data in real-time.<\/p> <p>Pizza begins at 6:15, the speakers at 7 then we'll head to the bar whenever we finish.<\/p> <p>Please arrive early to grab a seat.

            "<p>We have two awesome people coming this month.  Our speaker is Bill Cleveland, progenitor of the term data science, inventor of the loess curve and popularizer of trellis charts.  He will be preceded by a brief introduction to the International Year of Statistics by Ronald Wasserstein, Executive Director of the American Statistical Association.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p><br/>D&amp;R is a new approach to the analysis of large complex data. The goals are the following: (1) Provide the data analyst with methods and a computational environment that enable study of large data with almost the same comprehensiveness and detail that we can small data. (2) The analyst uses an interactive language for data analysis that is both highly flexible and enables highly time-efficient programming with the data.(3) Underneath the language, a distributed database and parallel compute engine makes computation feasible and practical, and is easily addressable from within the language. (4) The environment provides access to the 1000s of analytic methods of statistics, machine learning, and visualization.(5) Get a reasonable first system going right away.<\/p> <p><br/>In D&amp;R, the analyst divides the data into subsets. Computationally,each subset is a small dataset. The analyst applies analytic methods to each of the subsets, and the outputs of each method are recombined to form a result for the entire data.  Computations can be run in parallel with almost no communication among them, making them nearly embarrassingly parallel, the simplest possible parallel processing.One of our D&amp;R research thrusts uses statistics to develop ``best''division and recombination methods for analytic methods. This is critical because the division and recombination methods have an immense impact on the statistical accuracy of the D&amp;R result for an analytic method. Another thrust is a D&amp;R computational environment that has two widely used components, the R interactive environment for data analysis,and the Hadoop distributed database and parallel compute engine. Our RHIPE merger of them passes the embarrassingly parallel D&amp;R computations off to Hadoop. The analyst programs this wholly from within R, insulated from the complexity of distributed database management and parallel computation.<\/p> <p>About Bill Cleveland:<\/p> <p>William S. Cleveland is the Shanti S. Gupta Distinguished Professor ofStatistics and Courtesy Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University.<\/p> <p>His areas of methodological research are in statistics, machine learning,and data visualization. He has analyzed data sets ranging from small tolarge and complex in his research in cyber security, computer networking,visual perception, environmental science, healthcare engineering, publicopinion polling, and disease surveillance.<\/p> <p>In the course of this work, Cleveland has developed many new methods and modelsfor data that are widely used throughout the worldwide technical community. Hehas led teams developing software systems implementing his methods that havebecome core programs in many commercial and open-source systems.<\/p> <p>In 1996 Cleveland was chosen national Statistician of the Year by the ChicagoChapter of the American Statistical Association.  In 2002 he was selected asa Highly Cited Researcher by the American Society for Information Science &amp;Technology in the newly formed mathematics category. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American Association of the Advancement of Science, and the International Statistical Institute.<\/p> <p>Today, Cleveland and colleagues are developing the Divide &amp; Recombine approach to large complex data. Each analytic method is applied independently to each subset in a division of the data into subsets. Then outputs are recombined. Thisenables a data analyst to carry out detailed, comprehensive analysis of bigdata, to use only the R interactive software environment, and to easily run analytic methods in parallel. This is achieved through (1) statistics research to find D&amp;R division and recombination methods that give high statistical accuracy; (2) development of a D&amp;R computational environment that merges R with the Hadoop distributed database and distributed parallel compute engine.<\/p> <p><br/>Pizza begins at 6:30, the talks at 7 and then we will go to a nearby bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>For December we have Jay Emerson from Yale discussing his new package, ShinyHelper, designed to help people get started with Shiny from RStudio.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>In the beginning of the World Wide Web (WWW) there was HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programming.  And it was good.  New technologies appeared as the web evolved, with JavaScript and cascading style sheets (CSS) becoming the building blocks of the new millennium.  And it was better.  More recently, packages from Simon Urbanek (FastRWeb) and RStudio (Shiny) bring the power and flexibility of the R language to the web.  Examples will be provided (Hello World and more).  To help people get started with Shiny, I'll introduce my new package ShinyHelper (available on GitHub).<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nAbout Jay:<\/p> <p>Jay Emerson is Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Statistics at Yale University.  He has authored many R packages, including bigmemory (and sister packages), bcp, YaleToolkit, gpairs, and others.  He's currently working on a book about horse racing data analysis, and has two very cute and mischievous kittens temporarily housed in his office.<\/p> <p><br/>Pizza starts at 6:30, Jay begins at 7 and then we will head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>To start the new year we have <a href='http://jeroenjanssens.com/'>Jeroen Janssens<\/a> from <a href='http://yplanapp.com/'>YPlan<\/a> discussing how the command line can be used for data science.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>We data scientists love to create exciting data visualizations and insightful models. However, before we get to that point, usually much effort goes into obtaining, scrubbing, and exploring the required data.<\/p> <p>The *nix command line, although invented decades ago, remains a powerful environment for such data science tasks. It provides a read-eval-print loop (REPL) that is often much more convenient for exploratory data analysis than the edit-compile-run-debug cycle associated with scripts or even programs. Even if you're already comfortable processing data with, for example, R or Python, being able to also leverage the power of the command line can make you a more efficient data scientist.<\/p> <p>In this one-hour presentation we'll look at the following subjects:<\/p> <p>   Essential concepts of the *nix command line;<\/p> <p>   Setting up an efficient environment;<\/p> <p>   Filters such as cut, gre, sed, and awk;<\/p> <p>   Scraping websites using curl, scrape, xml2json, and jq;<\/p> <p>   Managing your data science workflow using drake;<\/p> <p>   Parallelizing and distributing data-intensive pipelines; and<\/p> <p>   Turning one-liners and existing code into reusable command-line tools.<\/p> <p>The main goal of this presentation is to give you have an understanding of why, when, and how you could use the command line for your next data science project.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Jeroen Janssens is a senior data scientist at YPlan, tonight's going out app, where he's responsible for making event recommendations more personal. Jeroen holds an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from Maastricht University and a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Tilburg University. He is authoring a book called \"Data Science at the Command Line\", which will be published by O'Reilly in summer 2014. Jeroen enjoys biking the Brooklyn Bridge, building tools, and blogging at <a href='http://jeroenjanssens.com/'><a href='http://jeroenjanssens.com\" class=\"linkified'>http://jeroenjanssens.com<\/a><\/a>. He can be found on Twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/jeroenhjanssens'>@jeroenhjanssens<\/a>.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAs per usual, pizza begins at 6:30, the speaker at 7, and then the bar whenever he finishes.<\/p> "

            "<p>One of the original members of this meetup, Harlan Harris, will present his work on spatial analysis using modern tools.<\/p> <p>The talk:<\/p> <p>Meetup organizers have to face a problem that's common to many other organizations. Where should I put my event, or factory, or chain of convenience stores, or cell phone tower? You could pay consultants many thousands of dollars to give you recommendations, or you can figure it out over a weekend using R! In this presentation, I will replicate an analysis we performed for DC Meetups, but using NYC home and work ZIP codes that YOU will provide (this information will be kept private). I'll show how to solve two location analysis problems: What would be the ideal location for NYOSP Meetup events? And what would be the best 3 locations that are convenient for everyone at least sometimes? [Sticking with downtown. -Jared] Techniques that will be discussed include: working with latitude/longitude data, constructing geometric cost functions, mapping, continuous optimization, global optimization, and dynamic report generation. R packages used include: knitr, plyr, reshape2, ggplot2, ggmap, and DEoptim.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nBio:<\/p> <p><a href='http://www.harlan.harris.name/'>Harlan Harris<\/a> has a PhD in Computer Science (Machine Learning) from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, and postdoctoral research experience in experimental psychology and cognitive science at Columbia University, UConn, and NYU.

            "<p>We are proud to invite back another former New Yorker, Ivor Cribben, for this month's meetup.  Given the nature of Dr. Cribben's talk we will be holding this meetup at NYU's medical center.  Yes, it is all the way by the East River, but it will be a good venue for this material.<\/p> <p><br/>Bio:<\/p> <p><a href='http://www.business.ualberta.ca/IvorCribben'>Ivor Cribben<\/a> is an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Finance and Statistical Analysis at the <a href='http://www.business.ualberta.ca/'>Alberta School of Business<\/a>, University of Alberta. He holds a BA in Mathematics from Trinity College Dublin, an MSc in Applied Statistics from University College Dublin, and a PhD in Statistics from Columbia University. <\/p> <p><br/>The Talk:<\/p> <p>Recently in brain imaging studies there has been an increased interest in quantifying changes in connectivity between brain regions over the experimental time course to provide a deeper insight into the fundamental properties of brain networks. The application of network science and graphical modelling has been instrumental in these analyses and enabled the examination of the brain as an integrated system. In this talk, I will outline some novel data-driven statistical methods that estimate the dynamic connectivity or networks between pre-defined brain regions using ideas from graphical models and time series analysis. I will also address the challenge of estimating a group-level dynamic connectivity structure across subjects. Finally, I will discuss the application of these new methods to simulated vector autoregression (VAR) data, to single-subject and multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from task-related and resting-state experiments as well as to Electroencephalography (EEG) data from a subject with epilepsy. Techniques that will be discussed include: working with fMRI and EEG data, graphical lasso, stationary bootstrap, and Granger Causality. R packages used include: glasso, gplot and JGL.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPizza starts at 6:30, the presentation begins at 7 and then we will head to a bar.<\/p> <p>Please note the new location and allow extra time to find the room.<\/p> "

Such transformation can bring both joy and pain; in biology, for example, this pain was experienced in the 1990s with the sequencing of whole organisms. Much of that experience---such as the demands for novel collaborations across previously-separated communities, and the opportunity to create new strategies for attacking the core questions of the discipline---has close parallels in both communities.  I'll use our time together to share some ways re-framing domain questions as machine learning tasks has opened up new avenues for understanding both in academic research and in real-world applications.  Please do reach out to <a href='mailto:chris.wiggins@gmail.com'>chris.wiggins@gmail.com<\/a> with any ideas you particularly would like to see addressed.<\/p> <p><br/>About Dr. Wiggins:<\/p> <p><br/>Chris Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University as well as Chief Data Scientist at the New York Times. Prior to joining the faculty at Columbia he was a Courant Instructor at NYU and earned his PhD in theoretical physics at Princeton University. His research focuses on applications of machine learning to real-world data.<\/p> <p>He is a founding member of the Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering at Columbia, serving on the Executive Committee, the Entrepreneurship Committee, and the Education Committee.

            "<p>This month we have Michael Kane from Yale discussing knowledge discovery in the biomedical sciences.<\/p> <p>Thank you again to Misha Lisovich and the <a href='https://foursquare.com/v/iheartradio-theater-new-york-ny/4b032755f964a5200f4d22e3'>iHeartRadio Theater<\/a> for hosting us.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout the talk:<\/p> <p>Electronic access to current, scientific literature is essential to continued discovery and progress in the biomedical sciences. The online literature provides for the efficient dissemination of published knowledge and has become ever more convenient, thanks to public databases such as PubMed. However there has been little change in the basic way we electronically search for information, i.e. by keyword-based queries and manual scanning of the returned titles and abstracts. This talk outlines my current efforts for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to integrate higher-level, semantic approaches to understand the relational structure of articles in scientific corpuses. I will place heavy emphasis on computational principles developed to address the challenge of creating an \"augmented knowledge discover engine\" that allows individual researchers to understand the landscape of relevant data in their subject area. The long-term goal of this project is to provide new perspectives on the current literature and identify new, potentially untapped areas for scientific discovery. <\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Michael:<\/p> <p>Michael Kane is part of the Biostatistics Faculty at Yale University. His research interests are in the areas of scalable computational learning, augmented knowledge discovery, and stochastic approximation. He is the 2010 winner of the American Statistical Association's Chambers Statistical Software Award for the Bigmemory Project, a set of software libraries that allow the R programming environment to scale to terabyte-scale data. In 2011 he was awarded a grant on DARPA's XDATA project, part of the White House's Big Data Initiative for design and implementation of an elastic, distributed computing framework. <\/p> <p><br/>In 2012 he was was the recipient of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  s Grand Challenge Round 11 Award for the semantic clustering of medical and academic literature. He serves as an Editor for the Journal of Statistical Software and is this year's Program Chair for the Graphics Section at the Joint Statistical Meetings.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nPizza starts at 6:15, giveaways and Michael's talk begin at 7 and then after we will head to a local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>A number of people have asked for a talk on Topological Data Analysis so here it is, courtesy of Steve Ellis.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>Data analytic methods possessing the following three features are desirable:<br/>(1) The method describes \"high-order dependence\" among variables. (2) It does so with few preconceptions. And (3) it can handle at least dozens, maybe hundreds of variables. <\/p> <p>However, if approached in a naive fashion, data analysis having these three features triggers a \"combinatorial explosion\": The output from the analysis can include thousands, maybe millions of numbers. Few methods exist possessing all three features yet which avoid the combinatorial explosion. Ellis has devised a data analytic method he calls \"Concurrence Topology (CT)\" which does so.<\/p> <p>CT takes an apparently radically new approach to solving this problem. It starts by translating data into a \"filtration\", a series of \"shapes\". The shapes in the series are called \"frames.\" A filtration is like a building. The frames are like floors of the building. But while the floors of a building are two-dimensional, the frames of a filtration can have dimension much higher than two.<\/p> <p>A filtration can have holes that are like elevator shafts in a building. Such holes indicate relatively weak or negative association among the variables. CT uses computational algebraic topology to describe the pattern of holes. Normally, there are no more than a few dozen holes, so CT avoids the combinatorial explosion. Often one can identify small groups of variables that are closely associated with a given hole. This process facilitates interpretation of the hole. <\/p> <p>A limitation of CT is that, so far, it only works with binary data. But quantitative data can always be binarized.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nAbout Steve:<\/p> <p>Steve Ellis wrote software in R (available upon request) implementing Concurrence Topology. A paper, written by Arno Klein and Ellis, introducing CT and demonstrating it on fMRI data has been accepted by a topology journal.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPizza begins at 6:15, announcements, giveaways and the talk start at 7, followed by the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We are back in August with longtime nyhackr member <a href='http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/members/11142508/'>Mike Dewar<\/a> discussing streaming data.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>At the <a href='http://nytlabs.com/'>New York Times R&amp;D Lab<\/a> we consume many streams of data:  Published articles, news wires, social media traffic, subscription events and page views.  We play with streams of data coming from electronic sensors attached to our computers, and we watch streams of data from sensors elsewhere in the world.  We think consuming data like this--in real time, not in batch--is going to become more and more common in the future, and so decided to explore what working with streams might look like.<\/p> <p>The result of our exploration is a project called  œstreamtools   (<a href='http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/'><a href='http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/\" class=\"linkified'>http://nytlabs.github.io/streamtools/<\/a><\/a>)--an open-source, graphical toolkit for dealing with streams of data.  In this talk I  m going to introduce streamtools and what it can do, and I  m going to use streamtools to talk about the future of data science.  I  d like you to come away wanting to use (and maybe even contribute to) streamtools, and to think about how using streams challenges your assumptions about what analysis and reporting can be.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nAbout Mike:<\/p> <p><a href='http://mikedewar.org/'>Mike Dewar<\/a> is a Data Scientist at the New York Times R&amp;D Lab.  Mike has a PhD from the University of Sheffield, UK, where he studied the modeling of complex systems using data.  His work now focuses on building tools to study behavior.  Before joining the New York Times, Mike worked at the New York tech company <a href='http://bit.ly/'>bit.ly<\/a>, and completed postdoctoral positions at Sheffield, Edinburgh and Columbia Universities.  Mike is a data ambassador for the non-profit organization <a href='http://www.datakind.org/'>DataKind<\/a>, and has published widely on signal processing, machine learning and data visualization.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPizza begins at 6:30, announcements and the talk start at 7 followed by a local bar afterward.<\/p> "

Reinforcement learning concerns problems with sequences of decisions (where each decision affects subsequent opportunities), in which the effects can be uncertain, and with potentially long-term goals.  It has achieved immense success in various different fields, especially AI/Robotics and Operations Research, by providing a framework for learning from interactions with an environment and feedback in the form of rewards and penalties.  <\/p> <p><br/>Shane will give a general overview of the subject of reinforcement learning, covering how to solve cases where there is uncertainty both in actions and states, as well as where the state space is very large.  He will also walk through several code examples in R for how to apply this to specific problems.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p>Shane is a researcher at Kepos Capital, a quantitative Global Macro firm located in New York City.  His research interests have largely focused on optimal portfolio transactions, which has led to a focus on sequential decision theory and computational learning theory. He has a degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University.

            "<p>Continuing to pull speakers from within our own ranks, we have Gene Ekster shedding light on how hedge funds and other financial firms use data.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About the talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>In the last 5-10 years, Alternative Data has been quietly transforming the investment process across Wall Street. The buy-side quants aren  t the only ones in on the action, in fact, most stat-arb shops are late to the party. Roughly defined, financial alternative data is the  œbig data   which doesn't arise from the financial system itself, i.e. not equity stock price / volume data, order book, analyst estimates or info from the SEC filings, etc. It is data from the broader world around us, online transactions, brick and mortar purchases, POS systems, clickstreams and the like.  We're going to walk though a few examples of how noisy, unstructured data become an investable signal using tools such as text mining with latent dirichlet allocation. We will show R code for paneling longitudinal data and discuss procedures for reducing bias in these data. However, overall this talk is going to be slightly less technical, with the aim of introducing the audience to the process of how hedge fund portfolio managers and sell-side research analysts are systematically generating returns by leveraging unique primary (bots / scrapers, channel checks) and third party datasets (including data brokers). This includes sourcing, compliance, scrubbing out PII, alpha generation related to revenue estimates and approaches to balance the secret sauce with product transparency.  Finally we'll ponder the future of alternative data in finance, aka why just a Bloomberg terminal is no longer enough.

Please note the location on 5th Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets.<\/p> <p>About the talk:<\/p> <p>The ability to identify others   emotions is an important aspect of human interaction. There are many different cognitive processes involved in the identification of emotions in faces, in sound or in text, some of which overlap with cognitive processes that are known to be involved in listening to music and playing musical instruments.<\/p> <p>We  ll present some recent research on the relationship between emotional perception and musical training    both methodology and (preliminary) findings. And since is the R meetup group, we  ll go into detail when it comes to the data collection and analysis platform which was built in <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R<\/a>, <a href='http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/'>Shiny<\/a>, and relies on <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub<\/a> for persistence.<\/p> <p><br/>About Saar:<\/p> <p>Dr. Saar Golde is the chief data scientist at <a href='http://knowledgent.com/'>Knowledgent<\/a>, an industry information consultancy, where he heads the Data Science and Advanced Analytics practice. He is also an <a href='http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/saar-golde'>adjunct professor<\/a> at the <a href='http://engineering.nyu.edu/'>engineering school of NYU<\/a>, where he teaches a class on Big Data in Finance.<\/p> <p>Dr. Golde holds a Ph.D. in Economics from <a href='http://economics.stanford.edu/'>Stanford University<\/a>, an M.Sc. in Management Science from <a href='http://english.tau.ac.il/'>Tel Aviv University<\/a>, and a B.Sc. in Physics and Math from the <a href='http://new.huji.ac.il/en'>Hebrew University<\/a> in Jerusalem.<\/p> <p>In a previous life, Captain Golde used to blow stuff up for a living, and he still enjoys looking at things go up in flames.<\/p> <p><br/>Pizza starts at 6:30, Saar begins at 7 and then after we'll go to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have an excellent talk that combines two great aspects of R: Shiny and Stan.<\/p> <p>We would like to thank <a href='http://www.theorchard.com/splash/'>The Orchard<\/a> for hosting us this month.  Please note the new location is at East 4th Street between Lafayette and Bowery.<\/p> <p><b>About the Talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>We will present <a href='https://github.com/jgabry/SHINYstan'>shinyStan<\/a> an R package and <a href='http://shiny.rstudio.com/'>Shiny<\/a> app providing a graphical user interface for exploring Bayesian models estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. In addition to demonstrating shinyStan  we'll also discuss the importance of making tools for model exploration (visualizing, checking and diagnosing, comparing, inferring and predicting) easier to use and more integrated with software for model building and computation.<\/p> <p>Most applied Bayesian data analysis requires employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain samples from the posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Diagnosing convergence, checking the fit of the model, and producing graphical and numerical summaries of the parameters of interest is an important but often laborious process that slows the down the creative and exploratory process of model building.<\/p> <p>shinyStan, a package for R and Shiny app, is designed to facilitate this process in two primary ways: <\/p> <p><br/>1) Providing interactive visual model exploration:<\/p> <p>shinyStan provides immediate, informative, customizable visual and numerical summaries of model parameters and convergence diagnostics for MCMC simulations. Although SHINYstan was initially envisioned to be a companion to the <a href='http://mc-stan.org/rstan.html'>RStan<\/a> package (the R interface to the Stan programming language for Bayesian statistical inference), it can also be used to explore the output from any other program (e.g. Jags, Bugs, SAS) or any user-written MCMC algorithm.<\/p> <p>\n\n2) Making saving and sharing more convenient:<\/p> <p>shinyStan allows you to store the basic components of an entire project (code, posterior samples, graphs, tables, notes) in a single object. Users can also export graphics into their R sessions as ggplot2 objects for further customization and easy integration in reports or post-processing for publication. <\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About Jonah:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jonah Gabry is a graduate student at <a href='http://stat.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University<\/a> studying statistics and concentrating on applications in the social sciences. He is currently researching statistical models for historical social scientific inquiry. Before studying statistics he used to study Spanish literature and was a <a href='http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jonah-sol-gabry-mn0002601363/credits'>touring musician<\/a> for a (very) hot second. <\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>About The Orchard:<\/b><\/p> <p>The Orchard is a pioneering music, video and film distribution company and top-ranked Multi Channel Network operating in more than 25 global markets. We have a robust technology practice that includes Product Managers, QA Engineers and Software Engineers who work diligently to provide our clients with cutting edge solutions. Some of our most exciting projects focus on data-driven insights and analytics tools as well as optimization of monetization and reach for our YouTube business.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\nPizza will begin at 6:30, announcements and the talk start at 7 and we will head to the bar after.<\/p> "

Oftentimes, these errors occur late in the analysis and provide no clear indication of which datum caused the error.<\/p> <p>On occasion, the error resulting from bad data won  t even appear to be a data error at all. Still worse, errors in data will pass through analysis without error, remain undetected, and produce inaccurate results.<\/p> <p>The solution to the problem is to provide as much information as you can about how you expect the data to look up front so that any deviation from this expectation can be dealt with immediately.<\/p> <p>We will talk about using the <a href='https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr'>assertr<\/a> package which supplies a suite of functions designed to verify assumptions about data early in <a href='https://github.com/hadley/dplyr'>dplyr<\/a>/<a href='https://github.com/smbache/magrittr'>magrittr<\/a> analysis pipelines so that data errors are spotted early and can be addressed quickly.<\/p> <p><br/><b>Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://github.com/tonyfischetti'>Tony Fischetti<\/a> has a degree in Cognitive Science from <a href='http://www.rpi.edu/'>RPI<\/a> doing research on visual short-term memory.

A big thank you to both of them for stepping in last minute.<\/p> <p><br/>We are once again hosted by <a href='http://www.iheart.com/'>iHeartRadio<\/a> who provided a wonderful selection of beer, water, pizza and sunglasses last month.<\/p> <p><br/><img src='http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/6/c/600_435802892.jpeg' /><\/p> <p>Members of this meetup can use the code <a href='https://www.eventbrite.com/e/new-york-r-conference-tickets-15739610599?discount=nyhackr'>nyhackr<\/a> to save $100 off tickets for the <a href='http://www.rstats.nyc/'>New York R Conference<\/a> on April 24th and 25th.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About the talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>Surveys are the preeminent tool to measure the attitudes of individuals    before those attitudes are translated into other observables, like voting, buying things, or plugging in a wearable device. But survey sampling and weighting present serious challenges and tradeoffs. For several applications, multilevel regression modeling, combined with post-stratification using data about the full population, offers an attractive framework to make confident estimates about attitudes and attitudinal change in the population. We discuss a few examples, and show some code that motivated the design of the <a href='http://andrewgelman.com/2013/10/09/mister-p-whats-its-secret-sauce/'> ˜mrp  <\/a> R package for structuring data, fitting models, and working with population poststratification. Next, we show where that package leaves off and what the future holds: <a href='http://mc-stan.org/'>Stan<\/a> code generation for fully Bayesian estimation of the model, and R to process posterior samples using the intuitive formula interface.<\/p> <p><br/><b>Bio:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://github.com/malecki'>Michael Malecki<\/a> works with a team of statisticians and software engineers at <a href='http://crunch.io/'>Crunch.io<\/a>, where he leads product development in visualization for the company's cloud platform; and he teaches Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization in Columbia  s <a href='http://datascience.columbia.edu/'>Institute for Data Science and Engineering<\/a> program. He began development on <a href='https://github.com/malecki/mrp'>mrp<\/a> in 2010 as a post-doctoral researcher under <a href='http://andrewgelman.com/'>Andrew Gelman<\/a>.<\/p> <p><a href='https://github.com/rtrangucci'>Rob Trangucci<\/a> is a core developer for Stan (<a href='http://mc-stan.org/'>mc-stan.org<\/a>) at Columbia where he researches hierarchical linear models and writes lots of C++ code.

Aaron will present practical approaches for detecting and avoiding potential pitfalls, as well as rigorous and repeatable processes for generating merge tables through reduction to de-duplication. The focus will be on techniques for quickly achieving high accuracy for data sets of moderate size, with brief excursions into the entity resolution literature, machine learning for distance metrics, and applying clustering and visualization techniques including multidimensional scaling.<\/p> <p>About Aaron:<\/p> <p><a href='http://planspace.org/aaron/'>Aaron<\/a> is an instructor at the <a href='http://www.thisismetis.com/'>Metis<\/a> data science boot camp. He is the original author of the <a href='http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjstat/'>rjstat<\/a> package for R, which is mostly unrelated to this talk. He made <a href='http://emacs.link/'>emacs.link<\/a>, which is also not related to this talk.

At the front end of Tessera the analyst programs in R.  At the back end is a distributed parallel computation environment such as Hadoop. The environment is designed to be back end agnostic, so that the interface stays the same regardless of the back end being used, making the environment useful for small data sets as well, and allowing new distributed computing technologies (such as Spark) to be plugged in.<\/p> <p>In this talk I will introduce Tessera and provide some hands-on examples of visualizing data using the Tessera Trelliscope package.

            "<p>For the first time ever we will meet on a Friday so as many people as possible can attend Hadley's talk!<\/p> <p>A big thank you to Twitter for hosting us this month and for providing pizza and beer.<\/p> <p><b>About the talk<\/b>:<\/p> <p>A fluent interface lets you easily express yourself in code. Over time a fluent interface retreats to your subconscious. You don't need to bring it to mind; the code just flows out of your fingers. I strive for this fluency in all the packages I write, and while I don't always succeed, I think I've learned some valuable lessons along the way.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss three guidelines that make it easier to develop fluent interfaces:<b><br/><\/b><\/p> <p>   <b>Pure functions<\/b>. A pure function only interacts with the world through its inputs and outputs; it has no side-effects. Pure functions make great building blocks because they're are easy to reason about and can be easily composed.<\/p> <p>   <b>Predictable interfaces<\/b>. It's easier to learn a function if it's consistent, because you can learn the behaviour of a whole group of functions at once. I'll highlight the benefits of predictability with some of my favourite R \"WAT\"s (including `c()`, `sapply()` and `sample()`).<\/p> <p>   <b>Pipes<\/b>. Pure predictable functions are nice in isolation but are most powerful in combination. The pipe, `%&gt;%`, is particularly in important when combining many functions because it turns function composition on its head so you can read it from left-to-right. I'll show you how this has helped me build dplyr, rvest, ggvis, lowliner, stringr and more.<\/p> <p>This talk will help you make best use of my recent packages, and teach you how to apply the same principles to make your own code easier to use.<\/p> <p><b>About Hadley<\/b>:<\/p> <p><br/><a href='http://had.co.nz/'>Hadley<\/a> is Chief Scientist at <a href='http://www.rstudio.com/'>RStudio<\/a> and a member of the <a href='https://www.r-project.org/foundation/'>R Foundation<\/a>.

Once in a while I wake up, and sometimes I even program something. And once I'm tired of that, I go back to sleep, regardless of whether the programming is finished. This work schedule lends itself to a style of programming that efficiently produces robust, simple, user-friendly data analysis software.<\/p> <p>I'll introduce the main principles behind my approach to writing data analysis software. Next, I'll present some common problems that my programming style completely avoids. Finally, I'll discuss how my programming style is well suited for certain projects and horribly inappropriate for others.<\/p> <p><br/>Some main ideas include:<\/p> <p>   I store the most raw form of data that I can, and then I think of my entire program as pure functions. To make it easy to store raw forms of data, I wrote vlermv, a library that maps Python dictionaries to files.<\/p> <p>   Systems should be so simple and legible that I can figure out how they worked after I have lost the source code and the documentation and only have the data.<\/p> <p>   I have a particular way of drawing flow charts. Based on what the flow chart looks like, I can identify problems with the design of the software.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Tom:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://thomaslevine.com'>Thomas Levine<\/a> is a neodadaist. In addition to sleep, he is interested in <a href='https://thomaslevine.com/!/user-2015/'>multisensory data plots<\/a>, \"data\", and <a href='https://thomaslevine.com/!/print-formaldehyde/'>letterpress printing<\/a>.

            "<p>We have Gene Ekster talking about his expanded research into working with small data.<\/p> <p><b>About the Talk<\/b>:<\/p> <p>The rapid uptake of alternative data research by both fundamental and quantitative institutional investors is shifting the investment landscape and creating innovative sources of alpha generation. The field is still in the early phases of development, yet depending on the resources and risk tolerance of a fund, multiple approaches abound to participate in this new paradigm.<\/p> <p>A key technical challenge of the alternative data field is the  œsmall sample problem of big data.   Quite often,  œquantamental   research is creating models aiming to predict GAAP operational metrics such as revenues. Unfortunately, most companies only announce those numbers once every 3 months. Thus, even if a potentially exciting dataset has only a few years   worth of back data, then a company specific model will have just 8-12 data points to work with. This greatly diminishes an analysts   ability to create a sensible model out of unstructured data.<\/p> <p>We will discuss some of the solutions to this problem though informed interpolation with R and Quandl (a novel approach) as well as a general discussion of the application of data science techniques in alternative data research within the financial context.<\/p> <p>To learn more about alternative data, see a recent white paper published by the speaker: <a href='http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/'><a href='http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/\" class=\"linkified'>http://www.integrity-research.com/driving-investment-performance-with-alternative-data/<\/a><\/a><\/p> <p><br/><b>About Gene<\/b>:<\/p> <p>Gene Ekster works with asset management firms and data providers in a consulting capacity to help integrate alternative data into the investment process.

            "<p>To start the new year we are inviting Todd Schneider who recently published a fascinating, in-depth analysis of NYC Taxi and Uber trips.<\/p> <p><b>About the talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>Personal computers are really powerful: more than powerful enough to analyze the full dataset of every NYC taxi trip from 2009 to 2015  over 1.1 billion trips! I'll go over my recent work <a href='http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/'>analyzing the full taxi dataset<\/a> using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and R, and discuss some underlying tips and techniques that I've found helpful for analyzing medium-sized datasets.<\/p> <p>It's not always clear what constitutes \"small\", \"medium\", or \"big\" data, but for the purposes of this talk, I'll consider medium data to mean \"a few hundred gigabytes\"  small enough to fit on your local hard disk, but big enough that you have to plan ahead and act deliberately if you want to extract meaningful insights within a reasonable amount of time.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Todd:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='http://toddwschneider.com'>Todd Schneider<\/a> writes software at <a href='http://genius.com'>Genius<\/a>.

We are going to have a great lineup again this year so stay tuned.<\/p> <p><b>About the talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>Often, fairly simple parametric models are preferable to complex machine learning methods. Two common examples are in time-series work, where the data are not independent and dependencies need to be modeled explicitly, and in causal research, where consistent estimates of the parameters themselves are the primary object of interest. Jim will discuss the usefulness of the Random Forest's proximity matrix in this sort of work. He will present two new methods: <\/p> <p>- <b>Proximity matching: <\/b>A technique for building synthetic control groups for causal analysis on observational data. This method largely overcomes both the dimensionality issues and Smith-Todd critique of other matching methods.<\/p> <p>- <b>Analogy weighting: <\/b>A method for constructing weights to use in time-series models. This weighting scheme allows researchers to give weight to relevant periods of history and ignore irrelevant periods. In doing so, it frees modelers from having to decide on a look-back window for estimation.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Jim:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jim Savage is Data Science Lead at <a href='http://lendable.io/'>Lendable<\/a>, a frontier markets finance start-up. He recently moved to NY from Australia, where he worked at a leading think-tank on pensions policies, and in macroeconomic modeling at the Australian Treasury. In 2014, he was a fellow at the University of Chicago's Data Science for Social Good fellowship (hurry! <a href='http://dssg.uchicago.edu/'>2016 applications close soon<\/a>).<\/p> <p>\n\nPizza begins at 7:30, the talk shortly after and then we'll head to a local bar.<\/p> "

Further, effectively visualizing how social networks emerge or change over time is still a great challenge. In this talk I will briefly recap standard methods for visualizing social networks in R using packages such as <a href='http://igraph.org/'>igraph<\/a> as well as transferring R data to other visualization tools such as <a href='https://gephi.org/'>Gephi<\/a> or <a href='https://d3js.org/'>d3.js<\/a>. I will also give examples of some recently developed R packages and <a href='http://www.htmlwidgets.org/'>htmlwidgets<\/a> such as <a href='https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/'>networkD3<\/a>, <a href='http://dataknowledge.github.io/visNetwork/'>visNetwork<\/a> and <a href='https://github.com/bwlewis/rthreejs'>threejs<\/a> that provide user interactivity. Finally, I shall describe some ways in which the temporal dynamics of social networks can be captured.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About James:<\/b><\/p> <p>Professor James Curley is an Assistant Professor of <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/'>Psychology at Columbia University<\/a> and executive member of the Columbia Center for Integrative Animal Behavior.

            "<p>This month we have a double whammy from Europe with Jeroen Janssens from the Netherlands (and formerly NY) discussing doing data science in multiple languages and Tristan Deleu from France talking about external memory for neural networks.<\/p> <p>Thank you to <a href='http://www.ebaynyc.com/'>eBay<\/a> for hosting us and providing pizza.  And thank you to <a href='http://www.snowflake.net/'>Snowflake<\/a> for sponsoring this month's meetup.<\/p> <p><b>About The Polyglot Data Scientist:<\/b><\/p> <p>It  s generally good practice to stick to one programming language or one computing environment. The code will most likely be more consistent, more stable, and easier to maintain. However, sometimes, especially for exploratory data science projects, it can be more effective or efficient to mix and match. For instance, consider the situation where you want to make use of a fast machine-learning library. It turns out that this library is written in C++, but you work in R, and there are no language bindings available yet. Or consider the situation where you previously solved a certain problem in R, and now you need to solve that same problem again for a Python-based project.<\/p> <p>In this talk I discuss three approaches to become a polyglot data scientist. First, I demonstrate Beaker Notebook, which allows you to use multiple languages (Python, R, JavaScript, Julia, etc.) in one notebook. Second, I show several ways of combining programming languages (e.g., how to load R data into MATLAB, how to use a MATLAB package in Python, and how to call Python functions from R). This list of combinations is not exhaustive, but it will give you a good idea of the possibilities. Third, I explain how to write your own reusable command-line tools and employ command-line tools directly from Python and R. The command line is language agnostic, which means that you can combine tools written in just about any language. With a few simple steps, it  s possible to turn your existing code into a command-line tool.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Jeroen:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jeroen Janssens is an assistant professor of data science at Tilburg University. As an independent consultant and trainer, Jeroen helps organizations make sense of their data. Previously, he was a data scientist at Elsevier in Amsterdam and the startups YPlan and Outbrain in New York City. Jeroen holds a PhD in machine learning from Tilburg University and an MSc in artificial intelligence from Maastricht University. He is the author of Data Science at the Command Line, published by O  Reilly Media.

In this talk, I will present you one of the earliest example of this family of models: the Neural Turing Machines. I will introduce <a href='https://github.com/snipsco/ntm-lasagne'>NTM-Lasagne<\/a>, a library based on the open-source project <a href='https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne'>Lasagne<\/a>, to create Neural Turing Machine components as part of your Deep Learning models. I will also show you how this model works, its early applications to algorithm learning as well as recent developments in language understanding.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Tristan:<\/b><\/p> <p>Tristan is a Research Fellow at <a href='https://snips.ai/'>Snips<\/a>, a french startup developing a privacy-preserving Artificial Intelligence for connected devices.

All you need are the right ideas, some basic skills, and a great team. The week of the news leak about the L Train's future closure we were wondering how the tools available in CartoDB and those we're experimenting with could shed light on how life would be affected for straphangers through the Canarsie Tube as part of their daily life.<\/p> <p>With a mix of open source tools for doing geospatial statistics such as Moran's I and waypoint routing, hard-to-wrangle datasets like the American Community Survey (ACS) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LODES), some beer, and a version of CartoDB that we could push really hard, we learned a lot about New York City, the power of open source, ways to augment our product, and working together as a team.<\/p> <p>This talk will discuss the challenges we faced, the tools we tied together, the maps we made, and how CartoDB is more powerful as a result of these couple of dozen hours.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Andy:<\/b><\/p> <p>Andy Eschbacher is a map scientist at <a href='https://cartodb.com/'>CartoDB<\/a> where he works with the Research and Data team to bring in new data analysis, innovative cartography, and powerful methods for data enrichment to our open source stack.

            "<p>We dive into motor sports for August with Matthew Sheridan analyzing tire grip on Formula SAE race cars.<\/p> <p><b>About the Talk<\/b>:<br/>The only thing keeping your car from sliding off the road during a 60 mile per hour turn are four contact patches, each about the size of your hand. Understanding how the rubber generates forces between the car and the road requires complex physics and tons of data. Tire testing is extremely expensive, and as a result, testing more variables results in less steps within each variable. Students in Formula SAE usually solve the resulting multi-dimensional interpolation problem with Pacekja's famous \"magic formula.\" The \"magic formula\" requires finding the best fit of a 20 formula system of equations, so most Formula SAE members use proprietary software packages that do all the math for them.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I explain what is needed in tires to make a racecar go fast, and how I used non-parametric and semi-parametric regression methods as an alternative means to solve the interpolation problem. K-Nearest regression, thin-plate smoothing plots and ggplot2 are showcased as means of analyzing data that has more than 3 dimensions.<\/p> <p><b>About Matthew<\/b>:<br/>Matthew grew up in San Antonio, Texas, where he and his dad worked on motorcycles and old cars. In high school he built two cars with the Madison High School Solar Car Team and then worked on suspensions with the <a href='https://columbiafsae.org/'>Columbia University Formula SAE team<\/a>. He recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University and is currently doing a sustainability internship at the Related Companies.<\/p> <p><br/>Pizza begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

To this end, I've developed a number of packages that make individual parts of the process easier (<a href='http://ggplot2.org/'>ggplot2<\/a> for visualisation, <a href='https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html'>dplyr<\/a> for data manipulation, <a href='https://github.com/hadley/tidyr'>tidyr<\/a> for data tidying, ...). Recently I've been thinking more about how the pieces fit together. In the words of <a href='https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1535'>Hal Abelson<\/a>, \"No matter how complex and polished the individual operations are, it is often the quality of the glue that most directly determines the power of the system.\"<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll discuss the idea of the <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse'>tidyverse<\/a>, a set of conventions that ties together disparate package to provide a uniform interface for doing data science. Along the way you'll learn about tidy data, <a href='https://github.com/hadley/tibble'>tibbles<\/a>, list columns, pure functions, referential integrity, piping, and why <a href='http://ggplot2.org/'>ggplot2<\/a> should never have existed. <\/p> <p><b>About Hadley:<\/b><\/p> <p>Hadley is Chief Scientist at <a href='https://www.rstudio.com/'>RStudio<\/a> and a member of the <a href='https://www.r-project.org/foundation/'>R Foundation<\/a>.

Sad!\"). In August I did a <a href='http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/'>statistical analysis<\/a> that helped crack the code--Trump tweets himself from an Android, while his campaign staff tweets from an iPhone. I discovered clear signatures that differentiated tweets from each device, most notably that the Android tweets showed much greater levels of anger and disgust.  I'll explore the analysis in depth, and also show how you can use the <a href='https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext'>tidytext<\/a> R package to perform your own sentiment analyses.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About David<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/members/5551358/'>David Robinson<\/a> is a Data Scientist at <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/'>Stack Overflow<\/a>, where he analyzes data about the world's software developers.

In fact, the association was so strong that it made both spellings <a href='https://hilaryparker.com/2013/01/30/hilary-the-most-poisoned-baby-name-in-us-history/'>drop in popularity faster<\/a> than any other name in US history (with a few caveats). In this talk, we'll re-analyze the data using <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidyverse'>#tidyverse<\/a> tools and determine whether Hillary is still the most poisoned name in US history.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Hilary<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/members/13863480/'>Hilary Parker<\/a> is a Data Scientist at <a href='https://www.stitchfix.com/'>Stitch Fix<\/a> and co-founder of the <a href='https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast'>Not So Standard Deviations<\/a> podcast.

            "<p>For our last meetup of the year we have Adam Obeng talking text analysis and writing R packages.<\/p> <p><b>About the Talk:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda'>quanteda<\/a> is a package for the quantitative analysis of textual data, with a particular focus on methods used in political science. When I started contributing to quanteda six months ago, I had never written an R package before, I didn't know anything about text analysis in political science (some might say I still don't).<\/p> <p>Join me for an exploration of the features of quanteda 1.0, which creates text corpora, and extracts and analyses their features. It implements natural language processing functionality, scales document positions, creates topic models and does correspondence analysis. It slices! It dices! It can quantify how polarised your politicians happen to be!<\/p> <p>Along the way, I'll also share some of the unexpected challenges of developing an R package, from git workflow, to best practices in naming things (the Second Hard Problem of Computer Science), to handling really, really obscure text encodings.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Adam:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='http://adamobeng.com/'>Adam Obeng<\/a> is a sociologist of science and a computational social scientist, which is kind of like a data scientist except he hasn't quite graduated yet (PhD Sociology, Columbia (expected 2017)). He learnt R from our own Jared Lander [Adam wrote this bio] and since then has used his powers to help Microsoft to conduct polls and Twitter to fight trolls.

Recently popularized by a standout performance in the 2012 iteration of the ImageNet visual recognition competition, Deep Neural Networks have since facilitated countless everyday applications, including Tesla's Autopilot, Siri's voice recognition, and Google Inbox's suggested replies. Via analogy to biological neurons and human vision, this talk is an introduction to artificial neural networks that incorporates interactive demos and example code from popular open-source Deep Learning libraries.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Jon:<\/b><\/p> <p>Jon Krohn is the Chief Data Scientist at untapt, a machine learning-driven recruitment start-up based in New York. Previously, he deployed algorithms to automate predictions in the fields of brain imaging, genomics, finance, and digital advertising. Jon obtained his Doctorate in Neuroscience at Oxford University as a Wellcome Trust Scholar and has published in high-impact journals like Neurology, Nature Genetics, and Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS). Every third week in midtown, he hosts a Deep Learning Study Group that can trace its roots to an inaugural conversation at the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup.<\/p> <p><br/><a href='http://bit.ly/pizzapoll'>Pizza<\/a> begins at 6:30, the talks start at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> <p><br/><img src='https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/3/3/3/600_455869971.jpeg' /><\/p>"

While elegant and useful, it was designed in a time when models had small numbers of terms. As such, it has some limitations. In this talk, the good parts of the formula are shown as well as some of the limitations. Finally, an upcoming tidyverse package is shown that can be used when the formula method cannot easily handle the needs of the data and/or analysis.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Max:<\/b><\/p> <p>Max is the author or maintainer of nine R packages, including <a href='https://topepo.github.io/caret/'>caret<\/a>, and is the author of the Springer book <a href='http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/'>Applied Predictive Modeling<\/a>.

This package provides a visualization platform for creating and viewing large interactive \"small multiple\" displays, also known as Trellis or faceted displays. With small multiple displays, the data is split into groups and a plot is made for each group, with the resulting plots arranged in a grid. This approach is simple but very effective for displaying and discovering interesting patterns in data and is an essential visualization approach in the data scientist’s toolbox. TrelliscopeJS enables small multiple displays to come alive by providing the ability to interactively navigate a potentially extremely large number of plots. The TrelliscopeJS package integrates with common R workflows such as ggplot2 and the \"tidyverse\", and produces easy-to-share interactive web-based visualizations. Several interesting examples of TrelliscopeJS in action will be shown.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Ryan:<\/b><\/p> <p>Ryan Hafen is a statistical consultant and remote adjunct assistant professor at Purdue University. Ryan's research focuses on methodology, tools, and applications in exploratory analysis, statistical model building, statistical computing, and machine learning on large, complex datasets.

In this talk, I'll describe two real-world examples of this problem, and then will describe a Bayesian approach that combines a prior distribution with a (mostly) principled, statistically honest extrapolation method. A key piece of this approach is a class of semiparametric regression models called GAMLSS--Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape. These models can flexibly describe the shapes of the priors and temporal accumulation functions, and allow posterior predictive intervals that become more precise over time as information accumulates. This is important for nontechnical users of business predictions--the inevitable errors in overly precise predictions lead quickly to mistrust. I'll also compare the approach with classic time series forecasting techniques and with dynamic linear models.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Harlan:<\/b><\/p> <p>Harlan Harris has a PhD in Computer Science/Machine Learning from the <a href='http://illinois.edu/'>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<\/a>, and worked as a Cognitive Psychology researcher at <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/'>Columbia University<\/a> and <a href='http://www.nyu.edu/'>NYU<\/a> before turning to industry.

            "<p>This month, Emily Robinson (aka ERobs), tackles A/B Testing and its related challenges.<\/p> <p><b>About the Talk:<\/b><\/p> <p>A/B Testing has become the gold standard for measuring the effectiveness of changes to a company’s website or app, ranging from a change in the color of a button to a whole new advertising model. It’s used extensively at large technology companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google, as well as at small startups and non-tech companies.<\/p> <p>For companies with a lot of traffic and a data engineering pipeline already set-up, A/B Testing can appear to be exceedingly simple. But whether it’s trying to sequence experiments, work with non-technical partners, or deciding what to do when there is a bug, there are a number of issues that can complicate an analysis. We’ll cover some of these business and statistical challenges, using some recent experiments at Etsy as examples.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Emily:<\/b><\/p> <p>Emily is a Data Analyst at <a href='https://www.etsy.com/'>Etsy<\/a> where she works with the search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features.

Due to the current ubiquity of data (Big Data), and availability of on demand, inexpensive, and parallel hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on Amazon EC2, Deep Learning has revitalized the excitement in Artificial Intelligence. Breakthrough results can be seen in industry applications such as computer vision, robotics, healthcare, security, retail, and more. <a href='http://mxnet.io/'>Apache MXNet<\/a> is an open-source, fully-featured, flexibly-programmable and ultra-scalable deep learning framework supporting state-of-the-art deep models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). MXNet enables Data Scientists familiar with the R programing language to train and deploy deep models at scale, using their favorite language, with the same fast performance observed by Python, Scala or C++ ML practitioners.<\/p> <p><br/>Participants will learn how to spin up a pre-built, GPU enabled Data Science environment using the AWS Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image (<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB'>AMI<\/a>), in few minutes. We will write a deep learning program with MXNet in a few lines of codes using the R programming language. We will discuss training deep learning models on one or multiple GPUs via R. Finally, we will compare deep models to some traditional Machine Learning models such as penalized regression and boosted trees.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Dan:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='https://twitter.com/dmbanga'>Dan Romuald Mbanga<\/a> is a Business Development Management Lead for <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/'>AWS AI<\/a> platforms. Dan leads strategic business development initiatives for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engines, helping customers build end-to-end AI solutions at scale on AWS. He works with stakeholders in multiple AWS organizations including product, marketing, sales, and support, to ensure customers of all industries and sizes successfully grow their machine and deep learning workloads on AWS. Prior to assuming this role earlier in 2017, Dan joined AWS in 2013 as a Big Data and Devops Manager where he built two teams of specialists on the Hadoop ecosystem, and CI/CD technologies. Dan holds a BSc in Physics and Computer Sciences, and has over 12 years of experience building and managing engineering teams. In his spare time, he likes sports, travels, and learning new languages.<\/p> <p><br/><a href='http://bit.ly/pizzapoll'>Pizza<\/a> begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar. <\/p> "

More flexible and powerful than linear models, but more interpretable than many machine-learning approaches, GAMs are often the best choice for predicting and understanding complex nonlinear phenomena.<\/p> <p><br/>R's <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html'>mgcv<\/a> is the most popular package for fitting GAMs, but many users don't know just how versatile and powerful it is. Noam will survey the features of mgcv and demonstrate how it can be used to build GAMs that deal with a great many modeling needs: modeling continuous, count, or classification outcomes, fitting spatial data or time series, variable selection, dealing with complex hierarchical structures or fitting fully bayesian models.<\/p> <p><br/><b>About Noam:<\/b><\/p> <p><a href='http://www.noamross.net/'>Noam Ross<\/a> is a disease ecologist at <a href='https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/'>EcoHealth Alliance<\/a>, an NGO in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health.

            "<p>We close out the year with Niels Bantilan talking about how to reduce bias and discrimination that can unintentionally exist in machine learning models.<\/p> <p>Thank you to the AWS Loft (<a href='https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/ny-loft/' class=\"linkified\">https://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/ny-loft/<\/a>) for hosting us. The sign-in process can be time consuming so please allow extra time to enter the building. We will try to move people inside as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>Machine learning (ML) has the ability to learn the discriminatory patterns encoded in training data to influence socially sensitive decisions like parole-granting, hiring, and loan-approval. Many ML applications in these areas are classifiers that are part of larger systems that have a 'human in the loop' who uses the predictions generated by these classifiers to make better informed decisions.<\/p> <p>While this goal might be well-intentioned, measures must be taken to ensure that machine learning models don’t reproduce discriminatory patterns in training data because we risk amplifying those patterns in the real world. In this talk, I’ll be describing my thinking around what a 'fairness-aware machine learning interface' means and showing a bit of the functionality of themis-ml, a package that enables the user to measure and reduce potential discrimination in supervised ML models.<\/p> <p>About Niels:<\/p> <p>Niels Bantilan is a data scientist at Arena (<a href='https://arena.io' class=\"linkified\">https://arena.io<\/a> (<a href='https://arena.io/' class=\"linkified\">https://arena.io/<\/a>)), a startup that applies machine learning to transform the labor market by finding the best fit between people and organizations, primarily in healthcare organizations. He builds models to improve outcomes like retention rate, patient satisfaction, and employee engagement, and also builds internal tools to facilitate data science R&amp;D. His research interests include reinforcement learning, artificial neural networks, and fairness-aware machine learning. Recently, he released themis-ml ( <a href='https://github.com/cosmicBboy/themis-ml' class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/cosmicBboy/themis-ml<\/a> ), which is a Python library built on top of sklearn that implements an API for discrimination discovery and fairness-aware modeling.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href='https://nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html' class=\"linkified\">https://nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html<\/a>) begins at 6:15, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

We’ll present Via’s methodology for addressing the driver incentive side. Offering drivers personalized promotions to get them to work exactly when we need them requires a combination of a couple of different components, each of which is complex on its own:<\/p> <p>• Predicting how each driver responds to each promotion<\/p> <p>• Selecting the appropriate promo for each driver to hit attendance targets at the lowest cost<\/p> <p>We’ll go over why predicting how drivers respond to monetary incentives is a complex problem, and the active academic research on the topic. We’ll then explain the different models we built and how we selected an appropriate model, and how we tied the models to an optimization module to make promo recommendations on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>About the Speakers:<\/p> <p>Aleks Sinayev (<a href='http://asinayev.github.io/' class=\"linkified\">http://asinayev.github.io/<\/a>) is a data scientist at Via (<a href='https://ridewithvia.com/' class=\"linkified\">https://ridewithvia.com/<\/a>) Transportation working on building datasets and models used to describe and predict driver behavior as well as designing and analyzing experiments.

            "<p>Our March meetup features Jennifer Hill, co-author of Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (<a href='http://amzn.to/2sBvunJ' class='linkified'>http://amzn.to/2sBvunJ<\/a>) and Professor at NYU.<\/p> <p>Thank you to eBay NYC (<a href='http://friends.ebaynyc.com/' class='linkified'>http://friends.ebaynyc.com/<\/a>) for hosting us.<\/p> <p>We have a number of other events planned for the next few months, including office hours, master class and the 2018 New York R Conference (<a href='http://www.rstats.nyc' class='linkified'>http://www.rstats.nyc<\/a>). Members can use code nyhackr for a 20% discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>There has been increasing interest in the past decade in the use of machine learning tools in causal inference to help reduce reliance on parametric assumptions and allow for more accurate estimation of heterogeneous effects. This talk reviews the work in this area that capitalizes on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, an algorithm that embeds a tree-based machine learning technique within a Bayesian framework to allow for flexible estimation and valid assessments of uncertainty. It will further describe extensions of the original work to address common issues in causal inference: lack of common support, violations of the ignorability assumption, and generalizability of results to broader populations. It will also describe existing R packages for traditional BART implementation as well as debut a new R package for causal inference using BART, bartCause.<\/p> <p>About Jennifer:<\/p> <p>Jennifer Hill (<a href='https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Jennifer_L_Hill' class='linkified'>https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty/Jennifer_L_Hill<\/a>) works on development of methods that help us to answer the causal questions that are so vital to policy research and scientific development. In particular, she focuses on situations in which it is difficult or impossible to perform traditional randomized experiments, or when even seemingly pristine study designs are complicated by missing data or hierarchically structured data. Most recently Hill has been pursuing two major strands of research. The first focuses on Bayesian nonparametric methods that allow for flexible estimation of causal models without the need for methods such as propensity score matching. The second line of work pursues strategies for exploring the impact of violations of typical assumptions in this work that require that all confounders have been measured. Hill has published in a variety of leading journals including Journal of the American Statistical Association, Annals of Applied Statistics, American Political Science Review, American Journal of Public Health, Political Analysis, and Developmental Psychology. Hill earned her PhD in Statistics at Harvard University in 2000 and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Child and Family Policy at Columbia University's School of Social Work in 2002.<\/p> <p>Pizza ( <a href='https://nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html' class='linkified'>https://nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html<\/a> ) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>It has become our tradition to hold R Week in April with both a Meetup and the R Conference (rstats.nyc) in the same week. For this mega dose of R, we have Andy Liaw, the author of the randomForest package.<\/p> <p>Members of the meetup get a 20% discount with code nyhackr.<\/p> <p>Thank you to eBay NYC (friends.ebaynyc.com) for hosting us.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>Random Forests have been a very popular machine learning method for nearly two decades since its introduction by Leo Breiman. This classification and regression algorithm has proven itself very effective in many applications, and is robust as well as easy to use. In this talk we will briefly explain what the algorithm is. We discuss on an intuitive level what is needed for ensemble methods to work, and how random forests achieve that. Comparison will be made with other tree ensemble methods such as boosting. Based on the intuition, we will discuss possibilities for tuning random forests for better performance. We will also touch on how the variable importance idea that Breiman introduced in random forests can be applied to other Machine Learning methods.<\/p> <p>About Andy:<\/p> <p>Andy Liaw is a Senior Principal Scientist in Biometrics Research, Merck &amp; Co., Inc., where he applies statistics and machine learning to complex chemical and biological data to address problems in drug discovery. He is the author of the randomForest package for R. He holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&amp;M University.<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>For our first post-conference meetup we have long-time friend of the meetup, JD Long, better known as @cmastication.<\/p> <p>Thank you to Google for hosting us this month.<\/p> <p>To learn about more events, including our upcoming caret master class with Max Kuhn, check out nyhackr.org/events.html.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>JD Long will present on dplyr, one of the core components of the Tidyverse. dplyr allows easy creation of data pipelines within R. In addition to that, however, dplyr can also create complex data workflows in R and then convert them to SQL and execute them on your favorite database. The ability to read and write to SQL databases without the user having to write any SQL at all can save users precious time and decrease headaches around debugging SQL. JD will illustrate some basic uses of dplyr and also give examples of how he uses dplyr in practice.<\/p> <p>About JD:<\/p> <p>James (JD) Long works in reinsurance in New York City. He builds risk models which, according to George Box, are wrong. In spite of this inconvenient truth, James has proved successful at convincing his employer that his models are useful. James writes poorly commented, inefficient code using Python, R, SQL, and expletives.<\/p> <p>James grew up in Kentucky and has multiple degrees from the University of Kentucky. After being marooned on the archipelago of Bermuda for four years, James now lives in Jersey City, NJ with his Minecraft addicted 10 year old daughter and his wife, a recovering trial lawyer.<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

Data visualization is essential for exploring and understanding structures and patterns, and to identify unusual observations. However, the sheer quantity of data available means that new time series visualisation methods are needed.<\/p> <p>I will demonstrate an approach to this problem using a vector of features on each time series, measuring characteristics of the series. These feature vectors can then be mapped to a 2-dimensional space for visualization.<\/p> <p>The feature-based approach to time series can also be used to identify the best forecasting model using a pre-trained classifier, and to identify anomalous time series within a collection of time series.<\/p> <p>I will demonstrate how to do feature-based time series analysis using the tsfeatures, seer, stray and oddstream packages for R.<\/p> <p>About Rob:<\/p> <p>Rob J Hyndman is Professor of Statistics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. He is also Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Forecasting and a Director of the International Institute of Forecasters. Rob is the author of over 150 research papers and 5 books in statistical science. In 2007, he received the Moran medal from the Australian Academy of Science for his contributions to statistical research, especially in the area of statistical forecasting. For over 30 years, Rob has maintained an active consulting practice, assisting hundreds of companies and organizations around the world.

            "<p>Our speaker this month, Eugene Ha, comes all the way from Berlin to talk about composing functions.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>The magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) is a powerful and widely used idiom for chaining serial computations, aka pipelines. In practice, however, overuse of the pipe tends to conflate two rather distinct operations: passing a value to a function versus composing functions. Burdening the pipe to handle both operations can lead to unnecessarily slow and rigid code.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll introduce a new tool for working with, and thinking about, function composition: the gestalt (<a href=\"https://github.com/egnha/gestalt\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/egnha/gestalt<\/a>) %&gt;&gt;&gt;%. It enriches the semantics of the familiar %&gt;% syntax with annotations and tidyverse quasiquotation. Using concrete examples, we'll explore how %&gt;&gt;&gt;% works, how it complements %&gt;%, and how you can use it to improve the malleability, transparency, and performance of your functions.<\/p> <p>As a highlight, we'll also see how %&gt;&gt;&gt;% enables you to treat values as objects with internal structure. This is a new technique for extracting latent information from values, on demand, to aid exploration and understanding: instead of perusing and editing source code, you compute on values directly to inspect their creation and intermediate structure.<\/p> <p>About Eugene:<br/>Eugene Ha has enjoyed a varied career as a mathematician, acquisitions editor, technical writer and, most recently, data scientist. He has a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Bonn. In his open source work, he focuses on leveraging R's expressivity to make tools that enable you to do more with less fuss. Based in Berlin, he is currently in New York on sabbatical at the Recurse Center (<a href=\"https://www.recurse.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.recurse.com<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

For some people data.table syntax may at first appear less than intuitive so our goal is to reduce data.table’s learning curve by connecting data.table syntax with SQL and dplyr equivalents.<\/p> <p>About Bill:<\/p> <p>Bill Gold’s career intersects data science, management consulting and technology. He has delivered $500MM+ in ROI to financial services and healthcare clients. Across the customer lifecycle he’s developed and deployed: hundreds of models (some patented), commercial software and data science infrastructure with trillions of transactions and hundreds of terabytes of data, all servicing thousands of data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bill guest lectures as Columbia and NYU. He has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Hofstra University.<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>Following up on our earlier meetup about time series forecasting we have Earo Wang coming to us from Australia to talk about tsibble for tidy time series data.<\/p> <p>Thank you to AT&amp;T for hosting us. Note, this is a smaller space than usual for us so slots will fill up fast.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<\/p> <p>Mining temporal-context data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of time formats: irregular or multiple time intervals, multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, heterogeneous data types and nested and crossed factors indicating hierarchical sub-groups. Time series models, in particular, the software supporting time series forecasting, makes strict assumptions on data that need to be provided, typically a matrix of numeric data with an implicit time index. Going from raw data to model-ready data is painful.<\/p> <p>This work presents a cohesive and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn flows into visualization and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are applied, and extended to temporal data: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout, (2) including an explicitly declared index variable representing time, (3) incorporating a \"key\" comprised of single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time, using a syntax-based and user-oriented approach in which it imposes nested or crossed structures on the data.<\/p> <p>This tidy data representation most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a \"data pipeline\" in time-based context. A sound data pipeline facilitates a fluent and transparent workflow for analyzing temporal data. Applications are included to illustrate tidy temporal data structure, data pipeline structure and usage. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the R package tsibble.<\/p> <p>About Earo:<\/p> <p>Earo is currently doing research on tidy data structure and visualisation of temporal-context data, as part of her PhD at Monash University. She enjoys developing open-source tools with R, and (co)authors some widely-used R packages including tsibble, sugrrants, hts, rwalkr, anomalous and icon. She was described by Yihui Xie (author of rmarkdown, knitr, bookdown and blogdown) as \"one of the most impressive R ladies I have ever met\".<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We're going Bayesian this month as we welcome Jonah Gabry back to talk about the role of visualization in Bayesian analysis.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Bayesian data analysis is about more than just computing a posterior distribution, and Bayesian visualization is about more than trace plots of Markov chains. Practical Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an iterative process of model building, inference, model checking and evaluation, and model expansion. We will discuss how visualization is helpful in each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow (and statistical workflow more broadly) and is indispensable when drawing inferences from the types of modern, high-dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.<\/p> <p>About Jonah:<br/>Jonah Gabry is a core developer of the widely used open-source Stan software for statistical modeling and a researcher in statistics at Columbia University collaborating primarily with Andrew Gelman on methods and software for Bayesian data analysis. Jonah is an author of the rstan and rstanarm R packages, which provide interfaces to Stan, as well as the author of the shinystan and bayesplot packages for model visualization, and the loo package for model comparison. In addition to developing statistical software, Jonah is affiliated with several research centers at Columbia, including the Applied Statistics Center, the Institute of Social and Economic Research and Policy, and the Population Research Center. Outside of academia, he has provided statistical consulting to professional sports teams, major publishing companies, and other businesses, as well as US and European Union government agencies.<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>For the end of the year we have Hugo of DataFramed fame.<\/p> <p>This is a new venue and it has tight security restrictions. So the name on your government-issued ID MUST MATCH the name you registered, with which is your Meetup username, or you WILL NOT be allowed entry. So please make sure your Meetup username has your full name.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>This talk will focus on what data scientists do, what they don’t and what people expect them to do, from C-level to citizens and from pollster to politicians.<\/p> <p>Armed with insights from over 50 hours of conversations with data scientists from tech, academic research, digital media, management consulting, healthcare and many other verticals, Hugo will dive into the current state of data science, beginning with the responsibilities of today’s data scientists, how data science is becoming integral to every industry and how it necessarily relates to the decision function in organizations. He'll also explore the increasing professional specialization that’s emerging in the discipline, as well as the tools today and tomorrow’s data scientists need.

            "<p>Starting off the new year we have John Langford of Vowpal Wabbit fame.<\/p> <p>Please be sure to bring a government-issued photo ID that matches the name on your Meetup account.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Nearly all deployed machine learning tends to operate on supervised learning principles which are often inappropriate in settings where the learning algorithm generates the data that it is trained against. A new approach has been gaining traction over the last few years: treating such problems as reinforcement learning problems. I’ll discuss why, how, and where to do this with a few stories about where we have applied this approach in practice successfully, solving problems that supervised learning approaches simply fail at.<\/p> <p>About John:<br/>John Langford is a machine learning research scientist, a field which he says \"is shifting from an academic discipline to an industrial tool\". He is the author of the weblog hunch.net and the principal developer of Vowpal Wabbit. John works at Microsoft Research New York, of which he was one of the founding members, and was previously affiliated with Yahoo! Research, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, and IBM's Watson Research Center. He studied Physics and Computer Science at the California Institute of Technology, earning a double bachelor's degree in 1997, and received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002. He was the program co-chair for the 2012 International Conference on Machine Learning.<\/p> <p>Pizza (nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>For February we turn our attention to time series and anomaly detection.<\/p> <p>Please be sure to bring a government-issued photo ID that matches the name on your Meetup account. If you do not have a last name on your Meetup account we cannot guarantee you will be allowed in the building.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Data scientists and researchers are often tasked with measuring how a metric changes over time. Whether it's daily website visits, weekly sales, monthly unemployment rate, or annual population count, time series is one of the most commonly analyzed data formats across fields. This talk will demonstrate two statistical methods for approaching times series analysis, forecasting and anomaly detection, and when to apply them.<\/p> <p>While forecasting allows us to predict future trends, anomaly detection helps us uncover irregularities in our data. We will draw upon real-life examples to explore different anomaly detection algorithms and illustrate how forecasting can help us identify seasonal trends and set targets for the future.<\/p> <p>I will be introducing the following packages in R: Facebook's open-source forecasting package, prophet, Twitter's open-source AnomalyDetection, and its tidyverse counterpart, anomalize. Prior experience is not necessary and people of all levels are encouraged to attend.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker:<br/>Catherine leads the data science team at Codecademy, where her research helps empower millions of users around the world to learn how to code. She has been working on statistical programming for the past decade. Prior to transitioning to a tech startup, she worked on airline ticket pricing and demand economics at JetBlue, subscription modeling at New York Sports Clubs, and various stints in politics, healthcare, and consulting. Before that, she was a bike mechanic.<\/p> <p>Catherine is passionate about the future of data science, cities, technology, and code education. She is a repeat New York R Conference speaker, member of R-Ladies New York, and a graduate of NYC public schools and Wesleyan University.

Use code UGNYHACKR for a 20% discount.<\/p> <p>You can also use code nyhackr for a 20% discount to the New York R Conference May 9-11.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>The rise of deep learning has led to innovations such as self-driving cars, AlphaGO’s world champion beating Go AI, and the rise of voice assistants and computational photography. As a result, there has been a surge in companies and researchers looking to find the best deep learning library to experiment with, build their next app, or modernize their existing products in the age of AI.<\/p> <p>There are many deep learning toolkits, ranging from long used, supported, and robust academic libraries to new, state-of-the-art, industry-backed platforms. In this talk, I’ll share lessons learned from my fortunate (unfortunate?) experience working with different deep learning libraries in production. I will focus on what to look for in a deep learning library with a lens on building reliable, production-ready applications and services, or experiments that are easy to design and iterate. This talk will help you gain an understanding of ALL of the deep learning libraries: from the popular (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Caffe), to the lesser-known (CNTK, Deeplearning4j, coreML). You might even find that your best fit is using more than one!<\/p> <p>About Jesse:<br/>Jesse Brizzi is a Computer Vision Research Engineer at Curalate, a Philadelphia-based startup that leverages social content imagery and influencers/audiences to help their clients to sell more effectively online. He owns the full pipeline of Machine Learning Software Development; from the research and training of state-of-the-art deep learning models; to the engineering, design, and deployment of those models and services into production environments that see millions of deep learning requests a day.<\/p> <p>Jesse earned his MS in Computer Science from Stony Brook University, where he specialized in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. He graduated from the University of South Florida with a BS in Computer Science. In his spare time, he likes powerlifting, gaming, transportation memes, and eating at international McDonald’s.

            "<p>This month marks the tenth anniversary of the meetup! We've grown from 21 people to over 10,000 in that time.<\/p> <p>To celebrate we will have a series of events in the coming weeks, including meetups, workshops and the Fifth Annual New York R Conference (www.rstats.nyc).<\/p> <p>First up we have David Robinson.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>The best approach to a technical presentation is careful planning and preparation. But where's the fun in that?<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll demonstrate an exploratory data analysis in R on a dataset I've never seen in advance, and which was chosen by a friend for its novelty value. I'll demonstrate the use of tools such as dplyr and ggplot2 for data transformation and visualization, as well as other packages from the tidyverse as they're needed. I'll narrate my thought process to show how a data scientist thinks through a problem, and take suggestions from the audience at key points.<\/p> <p>About David:<br/>David Robinson is the Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp. He has previously worked as a data scientist at Stack Overflow and received his PhD from Princeton University. He is the co-author with Julia Silge of the tidytext package and the O’Reilly book Text Mining with R, as well as the author of the broom and fuzzyjoin R packages and of the e-book Introduction to Empirical Bayes. He writes about R, statistics and education on his blog Variance Explained, as well as on Twitter as @drob. This talk is inspired by his experience sharing screencasts of improvised data analyses on YouTube.<\/p> <p>Pizza (www.nyhackr.org/pizzapoll.html) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We continue our tenth anniversary celebration with R Week! We have four days of R events, including a Meetup, a day of workshops and two days of the fifth annual New York R Conference. Visit www.rstats.nyc for more information.<\/p> <p>First up, we have repeat Meetup speaker Jonah Gabry talking about Bayes in R using Stan.<\/p> <p>Thank you to Rise New York for hosting us this month.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>In this talk we will demonstrate the rstanarm interface to Stan, which emulates standard R model-fitting functions but uses Stan for the back-end estimation. As part of the demonstration we will also take a tour of the broader Stan ecosystem in R, which consists of many packages that assist with various stages of the applied Bayesian workflow. Finally, we will briefly cover the rstantools package, which enables anyone to develop their own R packages interfacing with Stan and contribute to the growing number of R packages available for fitting complex Bayesian models.<\/p> <p>About Jonah:<br/>Jonah Gabry is a member of the Stan development team and a researcher at Columbia University working with Andrew Gelman on methods and software for Bayesian data analysis. He is co-author of the rstan and rstanarm R packages, which provide interfaces to Stan, as well as the bayesplot and shinystan packages for model visualization, the loo R package for approximate cross-validation and model comparison, and the rstantools package for assisting with Stan-based R package development.<\/p> <p>Pizza (bit.ly/pizzapoll) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

We will describe the tools in the nullabor package that allow you to check that what you see in a plot is really there. These include drawing samples from different null distributions and making lineups for the data plot, computing p-values and power, and measuring difference in plots numerically.<\/p> <p>About Di:<br/>Di Cook is Professor of Business Analytics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Her research focuses on data visualisation, primarily visualising high-dimensional spaces, and more recently, statistical inference for data plots. She is a contributing author of numerous R packages, and maintainer of a couple.<\/p> <p>Pizza (bit.ly/pizzapoll) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>Turning again to deep learning we have Bill Gold talking to us about LSTM models.<\/p> <p>Thank you to AT&amp;T Labs for hosting us.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Deep learning models can be highly effective at finding patterns contained in unstructured data. The impact on our lives from these deep learning models is profoundly redefining consumer products and business processes. However, deep learning is a black box often using millions of activations.<\/p> <p>As a result, businesses that value explainability resist or do not leverage deep learning. For example, some risk, compliance and legal stakeholders resist using deep learning. The topic of this presentation is training &amp; explaining behaviors, strengths and gaps in deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.<\/p> <p>About BIll:<br/>Bill Gold’s career intersects data science, management consulting and technology. He has delivered $500MM+ in ROI to financial services, healthcare and legal clients. Across the customer lifecycle he’s trained and deployed: hundreds of models (some patented), commercial software and data science infrastructure with trillions of transactions and hundreds of terabytes of data, all servicing thousands of data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bill guest lectures at Columbia and NYU, is working toward an MS in Computer Science &amp; Machine Learning from Georgia Tech (expected 2022) and has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Hofstra University.<\/p> <p>Pizza (bit.ly/pizzapoll) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have more time series, this month from Jeff Ryan, the creator of the xts and quantmod packages.<\/p> <p>Thank you to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York for hosting us at the Daily Planet (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2IryeJZ\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2IryeJZ<\/a>), I mean Daily News, Building<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Time series are everywhere, and fundamentally different than all other data. To effectively work with these series demands highly specialized tools--as dates, times, notation, calendars, time zones, and more must be carefully managed while doing even basic operations like subsetting, merging, aggregating and dealing with missingness. If not handled properly, all of your analysis could be at risk. Specialized tools for time have been part of R since the beginning, but have seen enormous changes over the last decade. In this talk we’ll explore where we started, what we have now and what might be on the horizon. I'll try to show the whole story in code and tell my unique perspective as someone who’s been lucky enough to be part of its history--and actively working on crafting its future for R, and beyond.<\/p> <p>About Jeff:<br/>Jeff Ryan is a practitioner in the quantitative hedge fund space and a long time contributor to R in both finance and data management. He introduced quantmod and xts in 2007, and co-founded the successful R/Finance conference, held annually since 2009. Over the years he's watched how time series went from an esoteric topic to the hottest thing in databases. He thinks this increased focus is only getting started. He's a bit opinionated, and enjoys building simple but powerful tools that can stand the test of time. Jeff is currently working on what he believes is be the next big step in time series management.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have Max Kuhn, the author of caret and the tidymodels suite of packages, speaking about the new tune package.<\/p> <p>Thank you to Rise NY for hosting us.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Many machine learning models have hyperparameters whose values cannot be analytically estimated from the data. For example, the number of neighbors in a nearest-neighbor classification model. The tidymodels collection of R packages are a tidyverse interface to modeling. In this talk, the new tune package will be introduced. Examples of the tidy interface to model tuning will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p>About Max:<br/>Max Kuhn is a software engineer at RStudio. He is currently working on improving R's modeling capabilities. He was a Director of Nonclinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&amp;D in Connecticut. He was applying models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. Max has a Ph.D. in Biostatistics. Max is the author of numerous R packages for techniques in machine learning and reproducible research and is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Statistical Software. He, and Kjell Johnson, wrote the book Applied Predictive Modeling, which won the Ziegel award from the American Statistical Association, which recognizes the best book reviewed in Technometrics in 2015. Their latest book, Feature Engineering and Selection, was published in 2019.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We're starting off the new year with a talk about both R and Stan.<\/p> <p>Thank you to New York Presbyterian for hosting.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Factorization machines are a powerful, flexible, and interpretable tool for modeling interactions between variables. However, there are a dearth of implementations of these models which allow for principled uncertainty estimates, especially in R. This talk will discuss implementing Bayesian Factorization Machines in R and Stan, first introducing basic models, and then, extending these models using techniques from modern hierarchical Bayesian modeling.<\/p> <p>About Adam:<br/>Adam Lauretig is the Senior Data Scientist at JUST Capital, where he works on Bayesian discrete-choice models, ranking methodology, and analyzing survey data. Previously, he completed his Ph.D. in political methodology at The Ohio State University, where he developed Bayesian Word Embeddings to study decision-making American Foreign Policy, and worked on a project with the World Bank, examining the effects of democratization on discrimination in the Indonesian Civil Service.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

Three principal use cases can be identified: consuming a data model, building in-memory or local data models without relying on relational databases, and preparing consistent relational data models for consumption by others. Based on these use cases, he outlines the features of this package and discusses future development. The presentation will be interactive with live coding and a script that attendees can run during or after the presentation. The package is available on GitHub at krlmlr.github.io/dm.<\/p> <p>About Kirill:<br/>Kirill works on the boundary between data and computer science with more than 20 years of software engineering experience. He enjoys working with and contributing to the R ecosystem since 2012. In 2018 he joined forces with Christoph Sax to found cynkra, a Zurich-based consultancy that helps businesses and government institutions better understand their valuable data and communicate the insights, with a focus on the R ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>For the second talk in February we are very excited to have R Core member Thomas Lumley talking about the {survey} package.<\/p> <p>For the February 4th talk with Kirill Müller please visit <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/267493644\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/267493644<\/a><\/p> <p>Thank you to New York Presbyterian for hosting.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Multistage surveys run by all levels of government and academic research groups are a rich source of data. Traditionally, their analysis involved specialised software (and even specialised hardware); one aim of survey research in recent decades has been to make survey analysis relatively boring, so that it can be done safely by people with domain expertise. I will talk about the R survey package, which just had its 16th birthday. The package allows for exploratory analysis and modelling, and supports research into more efficient estimation in two-phase samples.<\/p> <p>About Thomas:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, and was at the University of Washington in Seattle for 15 years. He is now Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. His research interests include study design in epidemiology, semiparametric theory, computing and graphics, and genomics. Thomas blogs about statistics in the media at statschat.org.nz and about other topics at notstatschat.rbind.io. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and the American Statistical Association, and a member of R Core, and has taught short courses on R in thirteen time zones.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

When you write R packages, you also unlock a whole ecosystem of tools that will make it easier to test, document, and share your code. A fundamental belief in Zen is that you are already complete, that you already have everything you need. I’ll talk about why your project is already an R package, why you’re already an R package developer, and why you already have the skills to walk the path of development.<\/p> <p>About Daniel:<br/>Malcolm Barrett (<a href=\"https://malco.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://malco.io/<\/a>) is an epidemiologist, an R developer, and a co-organizer of the Los Angeles R Users Group. He likes to write R code, talk about R, and teach R. He was also recently the R Markdown intern at RStudio.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> "

            "<p>We have a special remote meetup this month featuring our resident expert in emerging viruses, Noam Ross.<\/p> <p>Due to COVID-19 there is no in-person component to this meetup but rather it will take place completely online at <a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/339371523\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/j/339371523<\/a>. Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>COVID-19 is the latest, and most impactful, of new infectious diseases emerging with increasing frequency in the 21st century. Novel contacts between humans and wildlife, and dense and increasingly mobile human populations all drive risk of pandemics like the one we are living through. I will discuss the data science and analytical challenges in identifying and predicting new emerging diseases and tracking, predicting, and managing COVID-19. I will discuss the R tools used by virus hunters and epidemiologists in addressing these challenges, and lessons that apply to other fields. Finally, I'll discuss ways R users and data scientists can contribute to supporting public health and preventing the next pandemic.<\/p> <p>About Noam:<br/>Noam Ross is Principal Scientist for Computational Science at EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health. Noam builds models to understand and predict disease circulation in wildlife, spillover into people, and spread through travel and trade. Noam also leads software peer review at rOpenSci, a developer collective that builds R packages and catalyzes communities to enable open research and data. He has a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of California-Davis. Follow him on twitter at @noamross.<\/p> <p>Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> "

            "<p>We are staying virtual this month which allows us to once again to bring in a speaker from afar. One of the most popular talks was about Generalized Additive Models, so we are excited to have Gavin Simpson give us another dose.<\/p> <p>Due to COVID-19 there is no in-person component to this meetup and it will take place entirely online. Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>To help recreate even a sliver of our normal experience we are going to experiment with a new virtual world for people to gather together. The link is <a href=\"https://gather.town/fAGXHrSx0tOJDlfC/r-conference\" class=\"linkified\">https://gather.town/fAGXHrSx0tOJDlfC/r-conference<\/a> . Starting at 6:30 you can go to <a href=\"https://gather.town/fAGXHrSx0tOJDlfC/r-conference\" class=\"linkified\">https://gather.town/fAGXHrSx0tOJDlfC/r-conference<\/a> at roam around a virtual office and chat with each other. At 7 you should proceed to the \"Talks\" room where you will be able to enter the Zoom presentation (also available at <a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/97889324001\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/j/97889324001<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Since we still can't be together for pizza, Scott's Pizza Tours is sponsoring again and offering everyone 25% off virtual tours booked by July 31. Use code NerdsLovePizza at <a href=\"https://www.scottspizzatours.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.scottspizzatours.com/<\/a> for the discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>A defining characteristic of ecological or environmental time series is that they are messy. They're full of holes, rarely long enough but often too big, and they have a tendency to start and stop at inconvenient times and places. On top of this, the things these time series measure are inherently complex, the result of myriad interactions and processes operating throughout the biogeosphere.<\/p> <p>In this talk I'll discuss how we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate nonlinear spatio-temporal trends from these messy time series and illustrate the range of models and data types that we can handle with the mgcv and brms packages. I'll explain what modern GAMs are and how they learn from data, before moving on to demonstrate modern developments in GAMs that allow us to model entire conditional distributions rather than the usual focus on means and expectations. And as I'm a geographer, not a statistician, I plan to do this with pictures, not math.<\/p> <p>About Gavin:<\/p> <p>Gavin Simpson is a Research Scientist in the Institute of Environmental Change and Society at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. He is a #fakebiologist and a #fakestatistician, but he does have two degrees in Geography from University College London in the UK, though he doesn’t make many maps.<\/p> <p>Gavin's research is broadly concerned with how ecosystems and the communities of species they support change in time and space, from seconds to millennia, from ones backyard to globally. He's been using R since before v1.0 and has developed or maintains a number of R packages, including vegan, for multivariate data analyses, and gratia, a package for working with Generalized Additive Models, which feature in much of his research.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event early, details will be sent beforehand. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> "

Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Our annual R Conference in New York is also virtual-only. We have an excellent lineup including Max Kuhn, Erin LeDell, Rob Hyndman, Jacqueline Nolis and Andrew Gelman. There are also two-days of workshops covering Machine Learning with tidymodels, git, Shiny, web scraping, GIS &amp; Mapping, EDA with the tidyverse and even scikit-learn.

As extreme as they might sound, these quotes reveal one of the most important things when it comes to production-software: testing should be done as extensively as possible. Most R developers are already familiar with standard package testing, but things can get a little bit different when it comes to interactive web applications: what do we test, why, and how? In this talk, Colin will start by developing the good practices when it comes to testing Shiny, and present some of the tools you can use to test your own applications.<\/p> <p>About Colin:<br/>Colin Fay works at ThinkR, a French agency Focused on everything R-related. During the day, he helps companies to take full advantage of the power of R, by providing training, tools and infrastructure. His main areas of expertise are data &amp; software engineering, back-end &amp; infrastructure, and R in production. During the night, Colin is also a hyperactive open source developer and an open data advocate. You can find a lot of his work on his GitHub account (<a href=\"https://github.com/ColinFay\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ColinFay<\/a>) and on ThinkR's account (<a href=\"https://github.com/thinkr-open\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/thinkr-open<\/a>). He is also active in the Data Science community in France, and an international speaker.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 6 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> "
